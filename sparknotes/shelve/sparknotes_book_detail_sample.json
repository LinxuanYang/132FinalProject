      "Winston Smith is a low-ranking\nmember of the ruling Party in London, in the nation\nof Oceania. Everywhere Winston goes, even his own home, the Party\nwatches him through telescreens; everywhere he looks he sees the\nface of the Party’s seemingly omniscient leader, a figure known\nonly as Big Brother. The Party controls everything in Oceania, even\nthe people’s history and language. Currently, the Party is forcing\nthe implementation of an invented language called Newspeak, which\nattempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words\nrelated to it. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal. Such\nthoughtcrime is, in fact, the worst of all crimes.",
      "\n",
      "As the novel opens, Winston feels frustrated by the oppression and\nrigid control of the Party, which prohibits free thought, sex, and any\nexpression of individuality. Winston dislikes the party and has illegally\npurchased a diary in which to write his criminal thoughts. He has\nalso become fixated on a powerful Party member named O’Brien, whom\nWinston believes is a secret member of the Brotherhood—the mysterious,\nlegendary group that works to overthrow the Party.",
      "\n",
      "Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, where he alters\nhistorical records to fit the needs of the Party. He notices a coworker,\na beautiful dark-haired girl, staring at him, and worries that she\nis an informant who will turn him in for his thoughtcrime. He is\ntroubled by the Party’s control of history: the Party claims that\nOceania has always been allied with Eastasia in a war against Eurasia,\nbut Winston seems to recall a time when this was not true. The Party\nalso claims that Emmanuel Goldstein, the alleged leader of the Brotherhood,\nis the most dangerous man alive, but this does not seem plausible\nto Winston. Winston spends his evenings wandering through the poorest\nneighborhoods in London, where the proletarians, or proles, live\nsqualid lives, relatively free of Party monitoring.",
      "\n",
      "One day, Winston receives a note from the dark-haired\ngirl that reads “I love you.” She tells him her name, Julia, and\nthey begin a covert affair, always on the lookout for signs of Party\nmonitoring. Eventually they rent a room above the secondhand store\nin the prole district where Winston bought the diary. This relationship\nlasts for some time. Winston is sure that they will be caught and\npunished sooner or later (the fatalistic Winston knows that he has\nbeen doomed since he wrote his first diary entry), while Julia is\nmore pragmatic and optimistic. As Winston’s affair with Julia progresses, his\nhatred for the Party grows more and more intense. At last, he receives\nthe message that he has been waiting for: O’Brien wants to see him.",
      "\n",
      "Winston and Julia travel to O’Brien’s luxurious apartment.\nAs a member of the powerful Inner Party (Winston belongs to the\nOuter Party), O’Brien leads a life of luxury that Winston can only\nimagine. O’Brien confirms to Winston and Julia that, like them,\nhe hates the Party, and says that he works against it as a member\nof the Brotherhood. He indoctrinates Winston and Julia into the\nBrotherhood, and gives Winston a copy of Emmanuel Goldstein’s book,\nthe manifesto of the Brotherhood. Winston reads the book—an amalgam\nof several forms of class-based twentieth-century social theory—to Julia\nin the room above the store. Suddenly, soldiers barge in and seize\nthem. Mr. Charrington, the proprietor of the store, is revealed as\nhaving been a member of the Thought Police all along.",
      "\n",
      "Torn away from Julia and taken to a place called the Ministry\nof Love, Winston finds that O’Brien, too, is a Party spy who simply pretended\nto be a member of the Brotherhood in order to trap Winston into\ncommitting an open act of rebellion against the Party. O’Brien spends\nmonths torturing and brainwashing Winston, who struggles to resist.\nAt last, O’Brien sends him to the dreaded Room 101,\nthe final destination for anyone who opposes the Party. Here, O’Brien\ntells Winston that he will be forced to confront his worst fear.\nThroughout the novel, Winston has had recurring nightmares about\nrats; O’Brien now straps a cage full of rats onto Winston’s head\nand prepares to allow the rats to eat his face. Winston snaps, pleading\nwith O’Brien to do it to Julia, not to him.",
      "\n",
      "Giving up Julia is what O’Brien wanted from Winston all\nalong. His spirit broken, Winston is released to the outside world.\nHe meets Julia but no longer feels anything for her. He has accepted\nthe Party entirely and has learned to love Big Brother.",

If control of language were centralized\nin a political agency, Orwell proposes, such an agency could possibly\nalter the very structure of language to make it impossible to even\nconceive of disobedient or rebellious thoughts, because there would\nbe no words with which to think them. This idea manifests itself\nin the language of Newspeak, which the Party has introduced to replace English.\nThe Party is constantly refining and perfecting Newspeak, with the\nultimate goal that no one will be capable of conceptualizing anything\nthat might question the Party’s absolute power.",

Eventually he escalates his rebellion through his sexual relationship with Julia. The relationship is a double rebellion, as it includes the thoughtcrime of desire. Winston doesn’t believe his actions or the actions of others will lead to the destruction of the Party within his lifetime, but before he is caught by the Thought Police he holds out hope that in the future someone will be able to look back at Winston’s time from a world that is free.",

The problem is that the proles have been subject to such serious poverty for so long that they are unable to see past the goal of survival. The very notion of trying to build a better world is too much for them to contemplate. All of these observations are set against the backdrop of the Party’s own identity as the product of revolution.

The slogan is an\nimportant example of the Party’s technique of using false history\nto break down the psychological independence of its subjects. Control\nof the past ensures control of the future, because the past can\nbe treated essentially as a set of conditions that justify or encourage\nfuture goals: if the past was idyllic, then people will act to re-create\nit; if the past was nightmarish, then people will act to prevent\nsuch circumstances from recurring.

        "This quote from Book One, Chapter VIII,\nemphasizes how one’s understanding of the past affects one’s attitude\nabout the present. Winston has just had a frustrating conversation\nwith an old man about life before the Revolution, and he realizes\nthat the Party has deliberately set out to weaken people’s memories\nin order to render them unable to challenge what the Party claims\nabout the present. If no one remembers life before the Revolution,\nthen no one can say that the Party has failed mankind by forcing\npeople to live in conditions of poverty, filth, ignorance, and hunger.\nRather, the Party uses rewritten history books and falsified records\nto prove its good deeds.",

At the time when it happens you do mean\nit. You think there’s no other way of saving yourself and you’re\nquite ready to save yourself that way. You want it to happen to\nthe other person. You don’t give a damn what they suffer. All you\ncare about is yourself.",

        "Julia speaks these lines to Winston\nin Book Three, Chapter VI, as they discuss what happened to them\nin Room 101. She tells him that she wanted\nher torture to be shifted to him, and he responds that he felt exactly\nthe same way. These acts of mutual betrayal represent the Party’s\nfinal psychological victory. Soon after their respective experiences\nin Room 101, Winston and Julia are set free\nas they no longer pose a threat to the Party. Here, Julia says that\ndespite her efforts to make herself feel better, she knows that\nin order to save herself she really did want the Party to torture\nWinston. In the end, the Party proves to Winston and Julia that\nno moral conviction or emotional loyalty is strong enough to withstand\ntorture. Physical pain and fear will always cause people to betray\ntheir convictions if doing so will end their suffering. ",

        "Winston comes to a similar conclusion during his own stint\nat the Ministry of Love, bringing to its culmination the novel’s\ntheme of physical control: control over the body ultimately grants\nthe Party control over the mind. As with most of the Party’s techniques,\nthere is an extremely ironic strain of doublethink running underneath: self-love\nand self-preservation, the underlying components of individualism\nand independence, lead one to fear pain and suffering, ultimately\ncausing one to accept the principles of anti-individualist collectivism\nthat allows the Party to thrive.",
