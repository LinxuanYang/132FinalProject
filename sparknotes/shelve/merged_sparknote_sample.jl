He buys a hundred square miles of land from an Indian tribe, raises a manor house, plants cotton, and marries the daughter of a local merchant, and within a few years is entrenched among the local aristocracy. Sutpen has a son and a daughter, Henry and Judith, who grow up in a life of uncultivated ease in the northern Mississippi countryside. Henry goes to college at the University of Mississippi in 1859, and meets a sophisticated fellow student named Charles Bon, whom he befriends and brings home for Christmas. Charles meets Judith, and over time, an engagement between them is assumed. But Sutpen realizes that Bon is actually his own son—Henry and Judith's half-brother—from a previous marriage which he abandoned when he discovered that his wife had negro blood. He tells Henry that the engagement cannot be, and that Bon is Henry's own brother; Henry reacts with outrage, refusing to believe that Bon knew all along and willingly became engaged to his own sister. Henry repudiates his birthright, and he and Bon flee to New Orleans. When war breaks out, they enlist, and spend four hard years fighting for the Confederacy as the South crumbles around them. At the end of the war, Sutpen (a colonel) finds his son and reveals to him that not only is Bon his and Judith's half-brother, he is also, in part, a black man.", "\n", "That knowledge makes Henry revolt against Bon in a way that even the idea of incest did not, and on the day Bon arrives to marry Judith, Henry murders him in front of the gates of the Sutpen plantation. Sutpen returns to a broken house, and becomes a broken—though still forceful—man; he slides slowly into alcoholism, begins an affair with a fifteen-year-old white girl named Milly, and continues in that vein until, following the birth of his and Milly's daughter, he is murdered by Milly's grandfather Wash Jones in 1869.", "\n", "Decades later, in 1909, Quentin Compson is a twenty-year-old man, the grandson of Sutpen's first friend in the country (General Compson), who is preparing to leave Jefferson to attend Harvard. He is summoned by Miss Rosa Coldfield, the sister of Sutpen's wife Ellen (and briefly Sutpen's fiancee herself), to hear the story of how Sutpen destroyed her family and his own. Over the following weeks and months, Quentin is drawn deeper and deeper into the Sutpen story, discussing it with his father, thinking about it, and later telling it in detail to his Harvard roommate Shreve. The story is burned into his brain the night he goes with Miss Rosa to the Sutpen plantation, where they find Henry Sutpen— now an old man—waiting to die. Months later, Rosa attempts to return for Henry with an ambulance, but Clytie, Thomas Sutpen's daughter with a slave woman and now a withered old woman herself, sets fire to the manor house, killing herself and Henry, and bringing the Sutpen dynasty to a fiery end.", "\n"]}, "character_list": {"link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/absalom/characters/", "character_list": {"Thomas Sutpen": ["\n", " - Owner and founder of the plantation Sutpen's Hundred, in Yoknapatawpha County, near Jefferson, Mississippi.

Her devotion and enthusiasm for her work was, in fact, enough to win her the French Legion of Honor. By the end of the war, however, Wharton found herself disturbed by what she saw as the profound social disruptions that had been brought on by the war. In the months after the armistice, she again picked up her pen to write what many critics consider to be her war novel.", "\n", "One would be hard pressed, however, to find any elements within ", "The Age of Innocence", " that even remotely address the disruption and the bloodshed of the First World War. Set in 1870's New York, Wharton's novel depicts a society that is in many ways the antithesis of war-devastated Europe. Old New York, Wharton's term to describe this wealthy and elite class at the top of the developing city's social hierarchy, was a society utterly intent on maintaining its own rigid stability. To Wharton, Old New York imposed on its members set rules and expectations for practically everything: manners, fashions, behaviors, and even conversations. Those who breached the social code were punished, with exquisite politeness, by the other members.", "\n", "The differences between the fractured society following the First World War and the Old New York of ", "The Age of Innocence", " are without a doubt dramatic. However, there is more of a connection between them than may first appear. Edith Wharton herself was born into the claustrophobic world of Old New York. When she began, at the age of fifty-seven, to write what would become her Pulitzer-prize winning novel, she had already witnessed an astounding amount of social change. Both horrified and fascinated by the chaos and the freedom of the new century as it headed towards modernism and war, Wharton was prompted to compare this new age with that of her own past. ", "The Age of Innocence,", " then, stands as both a personal recollection of the culture of Wharton's youth and an historical study of an old-fashioned world on the brink of profound and permanent change.", "\n", "It is believed that the expression \"keeping up with the Joneses\" once specifically referred to Edith Jones Wharton's parents, who were known throughout New York for their lavish social gatherings. Born into such an atmosphere of opulence, Wharton had access to all the privileges of an upper- class upbringing: education, travel, and the assurance of a good marriage. Yet for all the luxury of her youth, Wharton felt her individuality continually stifled by the rigid expectations and narrow perspectives of her class. Not surprisingly, these sentiments become central themes in ", "The Age of Innocence.", " Unhappily married at an early age to a man thirteen years her senior, Wharton faced, like Ellen Olenska, the temptations of adultery and the censure of divorce. As a writer, too, Wharton faced the criticisms of her class, who disdained and feared what they called the bohemian life of artists and writers.", "\n", "Post-war Paris was a far cry from this stifling environment, and Wharton was interested in tracing the differences between her past and present not only on a personal level, but also a historico-anthropological level. By the end of the War, rigid Old New York appeared as a lost world, a defunct civilization that bore little similarity to the present era. Like many authors of her time, Wharton was interested in evolutionary theories and the newly developing field of anthropology. To a great extent, it is this interest in the sociology of Old New York that gives the novel its keen sense of detached irony. While post-Civil War New York saw itself as the pinnacle of civilization, Wharton undercuts this picture by comparing its unbending societal customs to those of the most primitive tribes.", "\n"]}, "rate": "3.94", "category": ["high-school", "college"]}

Sammy jokes along with him, but he feels the contrast between himself, still single, and the married Stokesie. Stokesie is resigned to a life of working at the A&P, whereas Sammy, although admitting that he and Stokesie are much alike, seems to feel that such a future is beneath him.

Although they make a point of acting nonchalant (Queenie more successfully than the other two), the girls are well aware of the eyes tracking their every move. As long as the girls do not acknowledge the men’s interest, they are in a position of power—inspiring desire but not subject to it. Their strategy works well, and the A&P’s male employees—even the unyielding Lengel—show some degree of sexual interest. However, Lengel ultimately undermines this strategy and tries to lessen their power. By confronting the girls so bluntly, Lengel calls the girls on their behavior, embarrassing them by suggesting that they are well aware of the inappropriateness of their attire.

By quitting, Sammy intends to align himself with Queenie’s world, a world of sophistication, youth, and beauty, whose values seem opposite to those of the A&P. If he doesn’t go through with quitting, he feels he’ll be accepting the values he has come to associate with the A&P: conformity, authority, and shallow materialism.

Since then, he has continued to produce novels, short stories, poems, memoirs, essays, art criticism, and book reviews at an impressive clip. Updike has the unusual distinction of combining serious critical acclaim (although this has not been universal) and scholarly appreciation with a steady popularity with the reading public. Among his best-known novels are ", "Couples ", "(1968); ", "The Witches of Eastwick", " (1984), which was made into a popular movie; and the “Rabbit” series: ", "Rabbit, Run ", "(1960), ", "Rabbit Redux", " (1971), ", "Rabbit Is Rich", " (1981), and ", "Rabbit at Rest ", "(1990).

The series has been celebrated for its evocation of America in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

More recently, Updike’s negative review of a novel by Tom Wolfe drew a withering reply from Wolfe, and the subsequent war of words, waged in the pages and letters columns of several magazines, was gleefully followed by the literary world.

He hitchhikes or gets rides from people like his dad’s friend, Eugene. On his first day, Junior meets his future girlfriend, Penelope.

Penelope finds out and donates money in both her and Junior’s names.

Junior’s team plays an early game against Wellpinit on the reservation where the entire crowd turns its back on Junior when his team enters the gym. While Junior is checking into the game for the first time, a fan throws a quarter at him, hitting him in the head. Junior asks Eugene, an EMT, to stich him up in the locker room, but, just after he checks back into the game, Rowdy fouls Junior so badly he gives Junior a concussion.

He wants to become a famous cartoonist and to make money. Becoming rich and famous, Junior reasons, will help him to escape the Spokane Indian Reservation. The problem is that, from Junior’s perspective, what seems like better opportunity and freedom might, to the eyes of people in his larger community, look more like abandonment and betrayal. Once Junior decides to attend high school off the reservation at Reardan, he finds himself struggling both to discover his own personal identity and to relate back to the Spokane community. Junior has struggled, and often failed, to find acceptance there his entire life. He feels a responsibility to prove himself to Rowdy and the other Indians that see him as a traitor. At the same time, Junior tries to make a new name for himself at the all-white Reardan High School. At Reardan, Junior gains fresh perspective on the things that are bad about life on the reservation—alcoholism, hopelessness, and a lack of tolerance. But, with the help of friends and family, Junior is also able to relate his personal ambitions back to his Indian heritage.", "By wandering farther from home, Junior better understands his roots. Thanks to his dad and his dad’s friend, Eugene, Junior is able to see leaving the reservation and going to an all-white school as courageous. He isn’t a coward, but a warrior. Likewise, Rowdy helps Junior to see how his going to school off the reservation can be linked back to the nomadism—the wandering from place to place—that was a part of his tribe’s culture for centuries. It is the people wasting their lives getting drunk on the reservation, Rowdy suggests, that have forgotten their community.  As time goes on, Junior also finds belonging in other groups, like the Reardan basketball team, and he realizes that he is part of many less apparent communities, other “tribes,” like the tribe of poor people and the tribe of tortilla chip and salsa lovers. Junior takes comfort in the fact that he belongs to these groups. They strengthen his identity. At the same time, he hopes that, by asserting himself in the right ways, he can bring good things back to the communities that support him."], "Poverty and Privilege": ["One of the main differences between life on the reservation and life in Reardan is that most of the families on the reservation, including Junior’s, are poor. This means that Junior often misses meals and school because his parents have no money for food or gas. Embarrassed by his poverty, Junior does everything he can to keep his Reardan classmates from understanding the true state of affairs. He often invents excuses or lies to his friends by saying he accidentally left his wallet at home. The white students at Reardan are financially better off, but Junior is surprised to learn that the privilege that accompanies wealth and white skin doesn’t insulate his friends from pain and problems. Penelope, despite her popularity and beauty, is bulimic, and Gordy, despite his shining intellect, is emotionally isolated and has difficulty relating to others. These problems of privilege are no less real than the problems of poverty, but the main difference—the thing that makes poverty so challenging—is that poverty prohibits people from pursuing hope and opportunity. And, what’s more, poor people often find themselves without the privilege to sort through or find help for their own equally real emotional struggles."], "Racism": ["Junior always uses the term “Indian” to describe himself and the others on the Spokane Reservation. He never explains why he favors this term over the arguably more politically correct “Native American.” One can argue that “Indian” is more direct, less sugarcoated. Reardan’s white football star, Roger, certainly does not celebrate Junior’s heritage when he tells Junior that, “Indians are living proof that niggers fuck buffalo.”  Using the term Indian, then, is also a concession to the racism in Junior’s social environment. The net effect of the racism and bigotry levied against Junior and his tribe on personal, institutional, and national levels is a collective disempowerment that stands in stark contrast to the unconscious privilege and opportunity in the neighboring white communities. But, Junior comes to realize, he participates in these same structures of prejudice. Junior sometimes uses homophobic language, for example, as a way to relate to and communicate with people like Rowdy for whom such language is the norm. Junior’s friends, likewise, show him that he pays so much attention to Penelope in part because she is white. Junior’s realization that he, too, has some racial biases is a key part of his moral education."]}}, "quotes": {"link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/the-absolutely-true-diary-of-a-part-time-indian/quotes/", "important_quotations_explained": {"So I draw because I want to talk to the world. And I want the world to pay attention to me. I feel important with a pen in my hand. I feel like I might grow up to be somebody important. An artist. Maybe a famous artist. Maybe a rich artist. ": ["This quotation, which occurs in the first chapter, “The Black-Eye-of-the-Month Club,” explains Junior’s relationship to cartooning. The cartoons that pepper the text of The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian are actually by the artist Ellen Forney, so the book is a collaborative project between Alexie, who authored the text, and Forney, who drew the cartoons. Alexie began the book as a memoir, but ultimately decided that an autobiographical novel was more fitting for his material. Some would argue that Junior’s relationship to cartoons, which is one of the few media that Alexie has not pursued in his professional life, is a stand-in for Alexie’s adolescent relationship toward writing stories and poems. The passage shows how Junior would like to use his art as a springboard to a better life. But drawing is not just a way for Junior to cope with and escape the challenges he faces on the reservation. Drawing, as Junior explains elsewhere gives Junior a means to honor his friends and family. Junior’s drawing, therefore, is not just a selfish or self-involved pursuit. Drawing gives Junior his particular way of contributing to his community."], "Poverty doesn’t give you strength or teach you lessons about perseverance. No, poverty only teaches you how to be poor. ": ["Junior offers this observation on poverty in the second chapter of the novel, “Why Chicken Means So Much to Me.” Junior is reflecting about the difficulties that face his family and other impoverished Indians on the reservation, and, in the process, criticizes common romanticized notions about poor people pulling themselves up by the bootstraps, overcoming adversity, and pursuing the American dream. The ability to overcome adversity by escaping it is, in fact, one of the key indicators of a privileged life. Junior suggests that only privileged people—namely, people who have never been poor—can hold such romanticized ideas about what it means to go hungry or not to be able to help one’s friends. For the truly poor, there is no escape from poverty, and the only way to overcome adversity, is to get better at tolerating it. The quotation sets the matter-of-fact, no-nonsense tone Junior will use to treat much of the political material that crops up in The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian. Junior speaks with the authority of person who has both thought deeply about oppression and adversity and experienced them first-hand."], "I suddenly understood that if every moment of a book should be taken seriously, then every moment of a life should be taken seriously as well. ": ["Junior has this realization about the interrelation of aesthetic and lived experiences in the eleventh chapter of the novel, “Slouching Toward Thanksgiving,” during a conversation with Gordy. Gordy explains to Junior that to appreciate the whole of a great work of art, you have to appreciate its parts. When it comes to books, that means looking up individual words and researching their history. This makes immediate sense to Junior, for whom reading and learning have been a central component of life, but it also shows just how much of Junior’s energy has been directed toward escaping unpleasant life experiences—such as being bullied or going hungry—by reading books and making art. On the one hand, this is Junior questioning whether he has placed more significance on how he reads than on how he lives. But, on the other hand, Junior arrives at this renewed appreciation for every moment, no matter how difficult, because his literary education led him there. In this sense, books are not an escape from but, rather, an intensification of life."], "I used to think that the world was broken down by tribes,” I said. “By black and white. By Indian and white. But I know that isn’t true. The world is only broken into two tribes: The people who are assholes and the people who are not. ": ["This quote, which occurs about three-quarters of the way through the novel in the “Valentine Heart” chapter, is spoken by Junior to his social studies teacher Mrs. Jeremy. After Junior misses many classes because he’s attending funerals, taking care of his mother, or because his family doesn’t have the gas money to take him to school, Mrs. Jeremy tells Junior that it’s nice of him to show up. Junior’s classmates stand and parade out of the classroom in an act of protest, leaving Junior and Mrs. Jeremy alone. That’s when Junior delivers this brutal line. The quote is an indication of the evolution of Junior’s thinking about race. He claims to have learned that internal moral qualities are more important than external social or political factors, but, it is important to keep in mind, as a whole The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian challenges even Junior’s new binary. Plenty of characters in the novel are sometimes assholes, and sometimes compassionate and kind. Roger, for instance, says racist things to Junior when they first meet, but, after some time has passed, he loans Junior money and gives him rides home."], "All my white friends can count their deaths on one hand. I can count my fingers, toes, arms, legs, eyes, ears, nose, penis, butt cheeks, and nipples, and still not get close to my deaths. ": ["Junior offers these lines near the end of the novel in the chapter titled, “Because Russian Guys Are Not Always Geniuses.” He is reflecting on the prevalence of death on the reservation, its ties to alcoholism, and how death, too, is one of the factors that differentiate life on the reservation from life in the wider, white world. The quote not only illustrates this stark contrast in early life for young American Indians compared to white teenagers, it also shows off Junior’s unique sense of humor. Humor is one of the ways Junior copes with the death he has faced, and the joke, here, of counting up ones penis, butt cheeks and nipples to arrive at the tally of deaths one has experienced in life also contains a starker reckoning. When Junior divides his body into all of its components like this, it ultimately emphasizes the mortality Junior is speaking about. In the passage, Junior’s own body becomes a memento mori—a reminder for him that one-day he too will die."]}}, "further_study": {"context_link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/the-absolutely-true-diary-of-a-part-time-indian/context/", "study-questions_link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/the-absolutely-true-diary-of-a-part-time-indian/study-questions/", "study-questions": {"How does the novel treat the subject of racism? Do Junior’s attitudes about race evolve as the novel progresses?": ["Questions of privilege and social class in the novel—the fact that so many Indian families live below the poverty line, have limited access to public services, and inferior education—are closely tied to questions of racial prejudice and history. For most of his early life, Junior has relatively little interaction with the white world, but he does have the inescapable knowledge that he is an Indian, an “other” in American society, and he knows the disadvantages that come with it. Perhaps this is one reason why Junior uses the label of “Indian,” and never the more politically correct term, “Native American.” Junior feels society at large sees him, and so sees himself, as an Indian. But, regardless of how mainstream American society depicts them, Junior knows that all Indians are not alike. Each tribe has its own unique culture. Junior has insight into his tribe’s culture that hypocritical sympathizers like the white billionaire, Ted, cannot buy or steal. But, along with each tribe’s unique identity comes prejudice and stereotypes. Rowdy plays off stereotypes when, after blaming a prank on coastal Indians, he says, “You can’t trust them whale hunters,” and Junior sees Montana Indians, like Mary’s husband, as wild and scary.", "When Junior leaves the reservation for Reardan, other members of his tribe start to treat him like he is somehow less than Indian. At the same time, Junior’s first real exposure to white society makes him more aware than ever of his minority status. One of the key ways in which Junior’s understanding of racism evolves over the course of the novel is that he begins to see how the same structures of prejudice that have oppressed his and other Indian tribes are at work within himself. He objectifies Penelope because of her whiteness, he realizes. Gordy and Rowdy help him to see that being a victim of prejudice does not prevent one from being prejudiced against others. Junior also learns that, over time, superficial racial prejudices can be worn down. He becomes friends even with Roger, who, before they became friends, made the most racist joke Junior ever heard in his life. In the end, Junior sees the difference between Indian life on the reservation and white life in Reardan as mostly a question of privilege. As he says, it may be only “slightly better to live in Reardan than in Wellpinit,” but that slight advantage can be the difference between a successful and a miserable life."]}, "context": ["\n", "Context", "\n", "Sherman Joseph Alexie Jr. was born in Spokane, Washington on October 7, 1966.

The public opinion alternately reveres and devastates every general involved in the war effort. It also both criticizes and compliments the president. The public thinks that the North will win the war, then suddenly they believe the South will win it. The public opinion contributes to the general fatigue of the war, as everyone's intensities are drawn out by what they hear from others. Hunt also draws a distinction between peoples' real motivations and their motivations according to the newspapers. All of the public figures are human, but the way in which the public reacts to them almost suggests that they are not."], "The Power of the Presidency": ["Jethro and Ross Milton, among others, secure their faith ultimately in the president. The Northern army swaps generals, the war ebbs and flows, the citizens fall victim to the back and forth of gossip and public opinion, but the one constant is Abraham Lincoln. His constancy is of great personal significance to Jethro when they exchange letters, and Lincoln reveals the same issue that plagued Jethro troubled him. Lincoln commends Jethro on seeking out what was right and reminds Jethro that even in the midst of war, people must continue to value rightness as most important. Lincoln, indirectly, rescues Eb. He provides a way for Southern deserters to rejoin the Union without penalty. He does not want to enter into war but knows he must and remains steadfast in his decision. When everyone else falters with worry and when everyone doubts the war effort and that any good can come of it, there is still the president, firm and proud."], "The Importance of Redemption and Forgiveness": ["Grudges are especially dangerous during wartime. Hatred and anger seem to prevail, and Hunt emphasizes the Creightons' ability to forgive. Matt persuades the town not to hurt or kill Travis Burdow, who killed his own daughter. The Creightons forgive Mr. Burdow, who redeems himself by helping Jethro and by sending materials to rebuild the barn. John forgives Bill and talks to him as a brother while they are on different sides of the war. The townspeople support the Creightons against the few who try and punish them for Bill's actions. In this book, forgiveness is crucial in cases where people are motivated by good. The ability to redeem and forgive, especially during a time when everyone must exist among hatred and anger, helps the Creightons manage through the five years of the war."]}}, "quotes": {"link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/fiveaprils/quotes/", "important_quotations_explained": {" I don't know if anybody ever \"wins\" a war, Jeth.

He knows that the causes for the war have bred hatred and that in the end, everyone will end up paying for that.

The quote itself refers to the cold weather that he endures for fifteen miles each way, but the quote is relevant to more than the winter. This quote extends to the hardships Jethro and his family face throughout the war—missing and worrying about their loved ones, grieving Tom's death, anxiously wondering if the North would ever pull out a victory, wondering what the country would be like when the war was all over. If Jethro embraces this sentiment, then perhaps at the end of the five years he has something positive to take away. Ellen's statement to him seems prophetic in light of what the boy endures during the war."], " The world was turning upside down for Jethro.

Jethro is frightened at Mr. Burdow's presence and at Mr. Burdow's explanation for why he is there. Jethro is so scared he is nearly out of himself—this fear is nothing like any he has experienced before.

Regardless of Jethro's actions, Lincoln recognizes in them an honest attempt to do the right thing, and he seizes upon that and commends Jethro for it. This reaffirms Jethro's faith that the president is letting the same desire to do what is right guide his actions. The president may make decisions that some disagree with, but this letter represents his humanity, which is something that there is precious little of throughout the war."], " It was the saddest and most cruel April of the five.

Hundreds of thousands of soldiers are dead—hundreds of thousands of husbands, fathers, and brothers will not come home, including Tom. Also, there is much reconstruction to do. Even though the Union won, the country is still divided and deeply wounded. It also extends to the country's divided attitude toward slavery—just because there is an amendment abolishing slavery does not mean that people will readily accept blacks or will treat them nicely, employ them or respect them as fellow citizens. Milton's statement ends up being even more prophetic than that and takes on a whole new meaning when Lincoln is assassinated."], "How does Hunt represent the war in her book?": ["Hunt does not seem to be anti-war or pro-war. She represents the death and destruction of war but does not suggest that the Civil War was unnecessary. She does represent the war as an imperfect solution to a problem—a problem that seems to have no real answer. Hunt does not extol the virtues of either side of the war and even has a character fight for the South in order to represent the legitimacy of both sides. In many ways, the war is understandable—both sides have legitimacy grievances, and while in the wake of history it is easier to sympathize with the Union cause, Hunt fairly represents the complaints of the Confederacy throughout the text. The aspect of war that Hunt disdains heavily is Sherman's treatment of Savannah. It pillages homes, farmsteads, and land in a way that is disrespectful not just to the enemy, but to honor and to life itself. Hunt represents those acts in a tone of disgust, but she withholds such sentiment at other times throughout the text. Hunt also includes a portrayal of war's effects on the families on the home front. Indeed, for the Creightons at home, the war is as hard if not harder on them as it is on the soldiers actually fighting in it. The waiting, speculating, and sorrow that the soldiers' families must endure for years become nearly unbearable, yet they have no power to affect anything about the war. They can only wait and hope."], "How does President Lincoln shape Jethro's growth?": ["President Lincoln is as much of a teacher and role model for Jethro as Shadrach, but in a very different way. Jethro sees President Lincoln as a teacher for the entire country and is almost surprised when he finds relevance in the President's \"lessons.\" When he realizes that the president toils with many of the same concerns he is comforted, because it means that someone other than he is trying to find the right answers to what he believes are important questions. Lincoln is steadfast and remains consistent under mounting pressure and responsibility, much like Jethro. Jethro even thinks of the president's face and recognizes sadness and fatigue within it, much like Jethro manifests on his own face. Throughout the text Jethro feels a kinship with the president that develops during their written correspondence and then cuts like a knife when the president is killed. The president and Jethro also share the same faith that everything, in the end, will turn out okay. With someone like Lincoln in charge of the country, there was a safety net or kind of protection. With Lincoln gone, it seems much more difficult for the wounds of the country and its people to heal."]}, "context": ["\n", "Context", "\n", "Irene Hunt was born on May 8, 1907 in southern Illinois, where ", "Across Five Aprils", " takes place.

Although Hetty is more physically beautiful\nthan Dinah, she is cold and ugly inside. Hetty’s outer beauty masks\nher inner ugliness, especially to Captain Donnithorne and Adam.\nEven when Hetty cries or is angry, she still appears lovely to both\nmen. Adam is so blinded by Hetty’s appearance that he often misinterprets\nher tears and excitement as love for him. Hetty’s outer beauty also\nblinds Captain Donnithorne such that he loses control when she cries\nand he kisses her. Unlike Hetty, Dinah has an inner beauty because\nshe helps and cares for those around her. She comforts Lisbeth through\nthe mourning of her dead husband, and Adam takes notice of this.\nAdam does not think Dinah is as physically beautiful as Hetty, but\nhe is drawn to her love and mission to help those around her. His\nfeelings for Dinah change after he witnesses Dinah consoling Hetty,\nand Adam begins to see Dinah as outwardly beautiful. Eliot’s description\nof the natural beauty of the English countryside also shows the\ncontrast between internal and external beauty. On the day Hetty\nwanders off to find Captain Donnithorne, the day is beautiful and\nthe countryside is magnificent. However, Hetty suffers enormously\nunder the weight of her plight. Eliot uses this contrast to encourage\nthe reader to look beyond the surface and explore a deeper meaning."], "The Value of Hard Work": ["One of the chief differences between the good characters\nand the evil characters is their commitment to working hard. Most\nof the characters in ", "Adam Bede", " are hard-working\npeasants who spend their days laboring on farms, in mills, or in\nshops. Those characters are generally characterized by gentle intelligence\nand simple habits. They do their best not to harm others, and they\nproduce goods others can use and value. Examples are Mrs. Poyser,\nwhose dairy supplies the other villagers and whose cream cheese\nis renowned in the area; Adam, whose skills in carpentry are unmatched\nand who is a good and fair manager of people and resources; and\nDinah, who works in a mill. By contrast, those few malingerers in\nthe novel are generally evil as well as lazy. The strongest example\nof laziness is Captain Donnithorne, who often complains that he\nhas nothing to do, and whose boredom may well have contributed significantly\nto Hetty’s downfall. If Captain Donnithorne had been busy sowing fields,\nhe might not have engaged in his illicit and unwise affair. Those\nwho work hard take pride in their work, and they do not harm others\nbecause they are careful and meticulous and do not have time for\nidle self-indulgence."], "Love as a Transformative Force": ["Love has the power to transform characters in the novel.\nThe characters who love are portrayed as gentle, kind, and accepting.\nDinah, for example, is a preacher but is never preachy. She accepts\nHetty as she is, even when Hetty is peevish and selfish toward her.\nDinah’s love transforms Hetty in jail because she comforts and listens\nto Hetty and does not judge her. Before, Hetty was selfish and only thought\nabout her own happiness. After, she is sincerely sorry for the shame\nshe caused her family and even apologizes to Adam. Another example\nis Mrs. Poyser, and how she can be harsh toward those she loves.\nWhen Hetty’s crime comes to light, Mrs. Poyser is the only one in\nher family who does not seem to judge Hetty. Here, Mrs. Poyser transforms\nfrom strict and critical to a loving and accepting woman. The one\ncharacter that is not transformed by love is Mrs. Irwine, who is\ncritical and sharp and never manages to help others. She does not\nfeel, and so she is neither transformed by love nor capable of transforming\nothers. For example, at Captain Donnithorne’s coming-of-age party,\none of her presents to a peasant girl is an ugly gown and a piece\nof flannel. This gift only aggravates the girl and makes her reject\nthe present. Mrs. Irwine thinks she is giving the girls only what\nthey deserve, and therefore she is not transformed by love because\nshe does not care for anyone. Love only transforms the characters\nthat want to help people other than themselves."], "The Consequences of Bad Behavior": ["Bad behavior and wrongdoing have consequences that extend beyond\nthe wrong-doer, and even relatively small transgressions can have\nmassive collateral effects. The central lesson from Hetty’s experience\nwith Captain Donnithorne is that doing the right thing is important\nbecause doing the wrong thing might hurt others in ways that cannot\nbe controlled. Though Captain Donnithorne is not inherently evil,\nhe provokes bad behavior in Hetty because she cannot go to him for\nhelp when she learns that she is pregnant. Hetty is ashamed and\nonly thinks of herself when she commits her crime.

First, Eliot encourages readers not to judge their\nneighbors harshly but rather to accept those them for who they are.\nThis approach to interpersonal relationships stems in part from\nEliot’s realist approach to novel writing and partly from her worldview. Realism\ndemands that Eliot describe her characters as they are, not as ideas\nor in conformation with some literary ideal. Real people, of course,\nhave domestic lives as well as public ones, so it is important that\nMr. Irwine’s home life be part of the realist novel. Eliot’s worldview,\nwhich requires suspension of judgment on the basis of things like\nclass, religion, and gender, also fits with this kind of description. None\nof the characters in ", "Adam Bede", " is wholly good or\nwholly bad. None of them is easy to judge.", "Second, the personal approach encourages religious tolerance,\nof which Mr. Irwine is a prime example. Eliot writes in an age of\nreligious tension in England, and she wants to encourage a gentler approach\nto conversion and religion. Mr. Irwine, with his tolerance of Dinah\nand the other Methodists, might be viewed by some readers as too\nlax. Eliot seeks to show that he is motivated by love. To reveal\nhis motivations, she must show him in his home and help us understand\nand respect him. That is why it is important to Eliot that Mr. Irwine\nnot be seen as an “embodied system or opinion.”"], "No: people\nwho love downy peaches are apt not to think of the stone, and sometimes\njar their teeth terribly against it. ": ["In chapter ", "15", ",\nwhile Hetty preens herself in her bedroom after the first time she\nkisses Captain Donnithorne, the narrator makes this observation\nabout Adam’s love of Hetty. Like the peach, Hetty is pretty and\nsoft on the outside but inside has a hardness that does not match\nher outward appearance. Adam does not perceive the hardness on the\ninside. He believes Hetty must be as beautiful inside as outside.\nFor that reason, Adam is even more injured when Hetty turns out\nto have acted in an immoral way, both in her affair with Captain\nDonnithorne and in the killing of her own child. Adam’s love for\nHetty is foolish but forgivable in the novel because it is natural\nfor a man to fall in love with a breathtaking young woman. It is also\nnatural, if foolish, for Adam to believe that Hetty’s outward appearance\ncorresponds to an inner virtue. His is a wishful thinking, imagining\nher to be what he wishes she were and ignoring signs to the contrary.", "Throughout the novel, inner and outer beauty often fail\nto correlate. Captain Donnithorne and Hetty Sorrel, described as\nthe two most comely characters in the novel, are both vain, shallow,\nand selfish people. The villagers, especially people like Mrs. Poyser\nand Bartle Massey, may lack physical beauty, but in times of need\nthey are the virtuous, hardworking, charitable people on whom others must\nrely. On the other hand, Eliot is careful not to accuse all beautiful\npeople of vice. Both Adam and Dinah are described as very beautiful\npeople, and they are both filled with love of their neighbor and\na desire to do good for others. The only way to know people, in Eliot’s\nview, is live with them. People cannot be judged on appearances,\nwealth, or the quality of their speech. The best thing to do, she\nsuggests, is to love the people in each other’s lives and make every\neffort to see the good in them."], "“A man\ncan never do anything at variance with his own nature.” ": ["In chapter ", "16", ",\nCaptain Donnithorne attempts to confess his feelings for Hetty to\nMr. Irwine, and Mr. Irwine offers him this advice. Captain Donnithorne\ngoes to Mr. Irwine to tell him about Hetty in an attempt to prevent\nhimself from acting on his impulse to seduce Hetty. Instead, he\nends up trying to justify his potential transgressions because he\nhas attempted to resist them. He tries to convince Mr. Irwine that\na man can be convinced to act against his nature because of a combination\nof circumstances. Mr. Irwine is not convinced, and he tells Captain\nDonnithorne that circumstances are not responsible when a man commits\nevil.", "Mr. Irwine believes that human natures are all mixed,\nthat even the wisest of people can be foolish and even the best\nof men can commit evil acts. This nonjudgmental approach makes him\ngentle with sinners and induces the villagers to love him. It makes\nhis preaching practical, loving, and down-to-earth, and it is why\nhe is remembered fondly when he is gone. This gentle approach, however,\ndoes not suit some religious zealots, who would have him be more\nstern with the peasants in an attempt to convert them and keep them\non the right path. These people, whom Eliot apparently believed\nwere her readers, advocate a position of moral righteousness rather\nthan a tender touch. Although she feigns apology for Mr. Irwine,\nEliot makes clear that she believes his approach is the right one\nand that he breeds love where the more zealous preacher sows only\nhatred and contempt. Mr. Irwine is the novel’s single example of\na high-bred man who is good and kind, although even he has his faults.\nHis over-indulgence of Captain Donnithorne prevents the latter from confessing\nto him on the occasion of this meeting, and because Captain Donnithorne\ndoes not confess, the affair continues with disastrous consequences."], "No wonder\nman’s religion has so much sorrow in it: no wonder he needs a Suffering\nGod.

The\nnarrator describes the beauty of the scenery through which she flees\nand contrasts it with Hetty’s misery over her plight. The world,\nthe narrator says, takes no pity on the suffering of people, and\npeople need religion in the absence of any other solace. The Suffering\nGod refers to Christ, whom Christians believe died on the Cross\nto save mankind from Hell.

Hetty can find no comfort anywhere\nin the world, and Eliot suggests that the only comfort she may come\nto find is in the next world, where God may end her sorrow. The\nidea that God is a comfort to sufferers is emphasized throughout\nthe whole novel. Dinah preaches salvation through suffering. Other\ncharacters, particularly Lisbeth, criticize this doctrine, saying\nthat it seems like Methodists enjoy suffering, but when Dinah comes\nto comfort Lisbeth, she allows herself to be soothed by the gentleness\nof Dinah’s faith. Dinah writes to Seth about how only in suffering\nand sorrow can anyone truly be one with the rest of the world, where\nso much suffering and sorrow exist. And Adam is the living example\nof how personal turmoil can bring a man into closer communion with\nthe rest of the world. Only through his experience of pain over\nHetty’s affair, crime, and conviction does he lose his sense of\npride and the hardness of heart that characterizes him in the beginning\nof the novel.

The Harvest Supper is\nan annual tradition in which the Poysers host all their workers\nand others from the village at a huge meal to celebrate the end\nof the growing season. Eliot describes the meal in great detail and\ndevotes lengthy descriptions to each of the minor characters seated\naround the table. Delving into their personal quirks and their age-old\ngrudges, Eliot marks each of them with a texture of personality\nunique to themselves. She does not attempt to describe idyllic, idealistic\npeasants but attempts to describe real people, which comports with\nher realist novel. It also makes it hard to describe any of the\ncharacters either as good or bad, since they are all a little of\neach.", "The narrator’s tone here is sarcastic. The reference to\nother artists is a derisive shot at other novelists and painters\nwho portray poverty as somehow saintly and happy. Eliot rejects\nthis glossing over of the harsh realities of day-to-day living,\npreferring a more honest description, and she is not above making\nfun of those who do not. The narrator does not, of course, believe\nthat other artists actually observe “entirely genial, merry, broad-grinning”\npeople in other districts. He believes that life in other districts\nis the same as in Hayslope, where sorrow and happiness mingle freely\nand good and bad characteristics are present in every person.

Instead, the novel\nfocuses on the characters of Hayslope and how they react when a\ntragedy occurs in their midst. Adam is the central figure of the\nnovel because he is a good man who undergoes a significant personality\nchange in the face of great sorrow. Eliot begins the novel by showing\nus Adam in ordinary life. He is a carpenter and a hard worker, but\nhe is too proud of his work. Adam supports his family, but he is\ntoo hard on his wayward father. The death of his father causes Adam\nto reflect on his own character, but this sadness is not enough\nto bring about a complete personality change. The events with Hetty,\nhowever, cause Adam to completely reconsider his view of the world.\nThey change him by making him gentler, humbler, and, on the whole,\na better man. Eliot intends us to model ourselves in some small\npart on Adam. An admirable character, Adam is meant to guide readers\nthrough their own lives. The novel is a moral novel. It is meant\nto show how even so admired and brave and good a man as Adam is\nin the beginning of the story can be made better by a little compassion\ntoward his fellow man. The narrator often emphasizes this point\nwhen he breaks through the story to make comments. That is why Eliot\ncalls the book ", ". She intends to keep the\nfocus on him, even through the more exciting plot developments that\ncenter on other characters."], "Eliot claimed\nthat the scene of Hetty’s conversion of the jail was the point toward\nwhich the whole novel was driving.

Although Hetty is at the\ncenter of all the major action of the novel, she is not the subject\nof the story. Instead the story focuses on Adam and Dinah. To the\nextent that Dinah preaches to Hetty and the reader sees Dinah as\na preacher and religious woman, the scene is important for what\nit says about Dinah. It is also a critical scene because it shows\nthe effects of compassion in action. Where no one else could touch\nHetty’s hard heart, Dinah can through her gentleness and lack of\njudgment. The scene embodies the moral of the novel, that judging\nour neighbors is not a proper way to live and that love has more\ntransformative power than all the preaching in the world. For that\nreason, the scene is at the heart of the novel’s emotional power.\nIt crystallizes Eliot’s moral purpose in writing the novel and renders\nclear the meaning that is threaded through the rest of the story.\nBut because Hetty and even Dinah are really secondary to Adam in\ntheir place in the novel, the scene between them in the jail is\nnot the climax. This scene inspired the novel, but the novel grew\naway from it in the telling. Adam’s life is the more complex and\nmore elaborated allegorical version of the message encapsulated\nin the jail scene, and his life is the focus of the book."], "Why is Adam\nso blind to Hetty’s true nature?": ["Adam cannot see Hetty’s faults because he\nwants so badly for her to be the perfect wife for him and because\nshe is so beautiful. Adam falls victim to Hetty’s charms because\nhe believes the best of everyone. He sees the world in good terms\nand expects others to see it that way too. Because he loves Hetty,\nin his love he believes what he wants to believe about her: that\nshe is innocent, caring, and gentle. Adam also expects inner beauty\nto correlate to outer beauty. But Adam is a practical man, and to\nhim, building a strong, straight wall is doing God’s work. A wall\nseldom has characteristics that are much hidden from the human eye,\nand Adam expects people to be like walls, basically self-revealing\nof flaws and cracks. But people, of course, are not like that. Although\nHetty’s strength does not derive from good, she is strong in her\nown way, and her powers of deception are exceptional. Adam expects\nher to be the kitten she seems. Whether his infatuation and blindness\nlessen his character is something Eliot leaves to her reader to\ndecide.

As a young girl she was educated\nat the local school and then at boarding school. Eliot was deeply\nreligious throughout her childhood and adolescence because of her\npious family background and the influence of the evangelical Maria\nLewes, one of her instructors at boarding school.", "\n", "When Eliot was seventeen, her mother died and Eliot came\nhome to care for her father. In 1841, Eliot\nand her father moved to Coventry. While living in Coventry, Eliot\nmet Charles and Caroline Bray, who led her to question her faith\nby introducing her to new religious and political ideas. Eliot began\nreading rationalist works in 1841, which\nprompted her to reject formalized religion. She also became acquainted\nwith intellectuals in Coventry who broadened her mind. To her father’s\ndismay, she stopped going to church. This renunciation put a strain\non their relationship until his death in 1849.\nEliot identified herself as a rationalist for the remainder of her\nlife.

In a rather scandalous move\nfor the age, Eliot and Lewes later lived together in 1854,\neven though Lewes was married and could not divorce his wife. At\nthis point in her life, Eliot was still primarily interested in\nphilosophy, but Lewes encouraged her to focus on fiction. Because\nwriting was considered a male profession, Eliot chose a male pseudonym,\nGeorge Eliot.

While Methodism is an organized religion, Eliot was particularly\ndrawn to the religion’s belief that salvation is possible for all\npeople through personal effort. Second, the character of Dinah,\nwho is strong and powerful beyond normal social conventions, is\nperhaps inspired by Eliot’s own willingness to step outside normal\nsocial convention in her common-law marriage to Lewes and her novel\nwriting. Finally, the sardonic tone that the narrator takes toward\nsocial convention and the “lady reader” suggests a rejection of\ntradition.

According to Eliot’s account\nof the writing of the novel, the character of Dinah Morris is based\nvery loosely on Eliot’s aunt, and Adam Bede himself is based very\nloosely on Eliot’s father as a young man.

These similes are often drawn from rural landscapes\nand farm life, and they often use the phrase “just so” as a connector.\nThey give Virgil’s writing a descriptive richness by lingering at\ngreat length on some detail that might not otherwise have been illuminated.\nOften, Virgil uses the similes to give an interior depth to his\ncharacters, showing us by means of an analogy what it feels like\nto be that character in a given moment.

This idea underlies the parallel we see in the novel between the alchemist\n                    purifying metal into gold and Santiago purifying himself into someone capable of\n                    achieving his Personal Legend. According to the novel, the Soul of the World has\n                    created an ultimate desire, or Personal Legend, for everything, whether Santiago\n                    or a piece of iron.

Fear acts as the biggest impediment to\n                    achieving one’s Personal Legend. Santiago faces many obstacles during his\n                    journey, but he regularly feels tempted to abandon his quest when he fears\n                    losing what he has already earned.

The irony of this fear stems from the fact that\n                    Santiago earns ever greater rewards each time he abandons his fear and gives up\n                    his previous possessions.", "This quotation also raises the notion that a person should have no reason\n                    to fear anything if he recognizes that he plays a role in something greater than\n                    his own life. The camel driver speaks these lines to Santiago from experience,\n                    having lost all of his possessions when a flood destroyed his orchard farm. He\n                    acknowledges, however, that the same hand that writes a person’s life story also\n                    writes the history of the world. In other words, each person’s life plays a part\n                    in the larger world around him, and the camel driver suggests that God dictates\n                    that part. This realization doesn’t prevent a person from suffering tragedies,\n                    but if the person recognizes that his tragedy serves a higher purpose, he has no\n                    reason to fear any loss. This insight becomes important to Santiago as he faces\n                    challenges later in the book, particularly as he learns to stop fearing failure\n                    and to trust in the omens he sees."], "4. “The alchemists spent years in their laboratories, observing the\n                    fire that purified the metals.

Just as alchemists\n                    purify lead, removing its impurities to transform it into gold, a person can\n                    purify himself by focusing completely on living out his Personal Legend. This\n                    process strips the person of impurities, transforming him as the lead is\n                    transformed. Similarly, the alchemists the Englishman speaks of did not purify\n                    themselves because they wanted to create gold but because they became so focused\n                    on their Personal Legends that they rid themselves of all other concerns, “the\n                    vanities of the world” as the Englishman puts it.", "Santiago’s guides through ", "The Alchemist,", " including\n                    Melchizedek and the alchemist himself, stress to Santiago that he must also put\n                    aside all other concerns.

But abandoning\n                    these other cares acts as the equivalent of removing impurities from lead, and\n                    only by remaining committed foremost to living out his Personal Legend will\n                    Santiago transform himself. This idea implies that all other desires, including\n                    that for romantic love, should play a secondary role to pursuing one’s Personal\n                    Legend."], "5. “What you still need to know is this: before a dream is realized,\n                    the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way.

And every search ends with the\n                    victor’s being severely tested.” ": ["The alchemist says these last words to Santiago before the two part ways\n                    at the end of the novel. In short, the alchemist explains to Santiago why he had\n                    to endure so many trials if the universe, as the alchemist and others have said,\n                    does actually want him to fulfill his Personal Legend.

When Gerda\nwrites about being in the group sent on the death march from Grünberg, of\nwhich only 120 out of the 2,000 in her part of the group survived, she says\nof another group that was liberated earlier, “Had I been part of it my fate\nwould have been different. Less suffering, yes, but less happiness, too, I\nam sure.” Gerda clearly believes that the pain and hardship in her life have\nbeen more than offset by the happiness she has experienced. From her\nperspective, the war took her family, but it brought her a new family as\nwell: because of the war and the Holocaust, she met the man who became her\nloving husband and the father of her children. The idea that one must\npersevere through pain in order to experience joy has helped Gerda come to\nterms with her experiences."], "The Importance of Bearing Witness": ["In the epilogue, Gerda writes that she hopes her lifelong efforts to\nraise awareness about the Holocaust have given back some small part of what\nshe has received. One way she does this is by bearing witness to the life\nand death of those who have no other voice. Gerda strives to provide as much\nfirst-hand information as she possibly can about her fellow prisoners. In\nthe section describing her time in Bolkenhain, she describes what happens to\na fellow prisoner, Lotte, saying, “I cannot help but want to tell her story,\nfor I might be the only one left in the world who knows it.” Gerda believes\nher duty is to be as detailed as possible when she writes about the others\nin her camp. Just as she does not know what her family’s last days or weeks\nwere like, she recognizes that most Holocaust victims died in obscurity, and\nshe uses her memoir to try to right that wrong. In many instances, she\nincludes people’s full names and their fates, even if they are such minor\ncharacters that they are mentioned in only one or two sentences. For Gerda,\ntelling the stories of others who died is just as important as telling her\nown story, and she does so in a way that is both respectful and deeply\nmoving."], "Morality Is a Choice": ["No matter what their circumstances or situation, people have free\nwill, and they always have the option to act with morality and humanity.\nGerda illustrates this theme by writing about people who behave in\nunexpected ways, such as the decision by Frau Kügler, who works for the SS,\nto save Gerda’s life. By giving examples of people who, while working for\nthe Nazis, nevertheless behaved with humanity, Gerda illustrates that it was\nnot impossible for Germans during the Nazi era to act decently toward Jews,\nforcing the reader to question why it was only these few specific people who\nchose to behave humanely. By pointing out that some people chose to show\ncompassion, she makes the parallel point that those who behaved cruelly were\nmaking a choice as well. She also gives numerous examples of girls who\nhelped one another in the camps, at great personal risk to themselves. Even\nunder the harshest conditions, whether working for the Nazis or imprisoned\nin a slave labor camp, people are not entirely powerless or entirely unable\nto make a moral choice. Some become monsters, and some choose to treat\nothers as fellow human beings and thereby reaffirm their own\nhumanity."]}}, "quotes": {"link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/allbutmylife/quotes/", "important_quotations_explained": {"1. He looked steadily at me and then answered my thoughts. “Whatever\nyou are thinking now is wrong. It is cowardly.” I couldn’t deny it. He\nlifted my chin up and looked at me firmly again. “Promise me that no matter\nwhat happens you will never do it.” ": ["In Part One, Chapter 5, when Gerda finishes selling the family’s\npossessions to the neighbors to finalize their move to the ghetto, she\nrecalls hearing of a family that committed suicide together. She\nhalf-heartedly wishes that her parents would suggest this. As she is\nconsidering the idea, her father walks into the room and forces her to\npromise to never do it—though neither he nor Gerda specify out loud what\n“it” is. This scene is the first of two major events during which Gerda’s\nfather gives the impression of omniscience—he knows what she is thinking\nwithout her saying a word, and he knows what is best for her. The second\ninstance of her father’s wisdom is when he insists that she wear her ski\nboots despite the fact that it is summer—a request that ultimately saves her\nlife.", "Throughout the book, Gerda gives the impression of her father’s\nimpotence in the face of the Nazis—he cannot save his family or stop what is\nhappening to them. However, this scene makes clear that no matter what the\nNazis’ power, Gerda’s father still has the power to save her through small\nacts such as this one. Once Gerda is sent to the labor camps, she remembers\nthe promise she made to her father, and it motivates her to go on. In the\nMärzdorf labor camp, where Gerda is working both the day and night shifts,\nshe considers jumping onto the railroad tracks. At that moment, she gets a\nfeeling in her neck that reminds her of how her father had held her head\nwhile making her promise to never give up. At that moment, when death seems\nlike the only solution, the memory of this conversation, and of her father’s\nlove for her, gives Gerda the courage to stay alive."], "2. “I hope you will never be disillusioned. To you, life still means\nbeauty, and that is how it should be. Continue to go through mud without\ndirtying your feet.” She spoke without explanation or introduction and\nwithout finishing, and then she stalked away towards our\nquarters. ": ["In Part Two, Chapter 5, Tusia says this to Gerda while they are in\nBolkenhain together. Tusia’s words in the book have a prophetic tone,\nparticularly when she gives a similarly worded outburst in a fit of madness\nimmediately before her death at Helmbrechts. Despite Tusia’s apparent\nlunacy, her words are largely accurate. The idea that cruelty can breed\ncruelty is reflected in Gerda’s descriptions of the girls in the camp who\nsteal one another’s shoes, and the girl who betrays her fellow inmates by\nhaving an affair with an SS guard. However, these are behaviors that Gerda\nwould never exhibit, and her reaction to the brutality she is forced to\nendure provokes quite the opposite reaction in her. If anything, Gerda\nbecomes more dedicated to remaining kind and generous. The Nazis may destroy\nher body, but she refuses to let them consume her soul.", "The slave labor camps and the death march are the mud that Gerda is\ngoing through, both literally and figuratively, yet despite the hunger and\ndeprivation that she must suffer in order to survive, she continues to treat\nher peers with respect and dignity, thus not “dirtying her feet.” Although\nGerda recognizes the viciousness that is possible in humankind and that\nwhich she sees in the Nazis, she also stops to notice the beauty that exists\nin nature and in the hearts of the other girls in the camps. Her memoir\nfocuses more on the friendships that she manages to develop in the camps\nthan on the harsh treatment that the girls endure. Although the title of\nGerda’s book, ", "All But My Life,", " describes what the Nazis\nhave taken from her, she also succeeds at holding onto her own humanity, no\nmatter what the circumstances."], "3. My eyes remained dry. I felt my features turn stony. “Now I have\nto live,” I said to myself, “because I am alone and nothing can hurt me any\nmore.” ": ["Gerda’s thoughts, which appear in the first chapter of Part Two\nimmediately after she has been separated from her mother, are paradoxical,\nfor she implies that to lose everything is a kind of liberation. The natural\nreaction to losing all of one’s family members might tend toward becoming\nmore self-destructive, but Gerda takes the opposite view. Thanks to Gerda’s\nunique optimistic viewpoint, even her most morbid thoughts, such as this\none, reflect her positive perspective. Gerda finds that losing her family\nprompts her to go on living. She sees this loss as a new kind of freedom:\nnow she doesn’t have to worry about her parents’ welfare or being forced to\nmake the “right” decisions, and she can put her own desires before her duty\nto her parents, which feels like a reprieve from responsibility. Knowing\nthat her only duty is to look out for her own survival allows her the\ndiscretion to express the feelings, such as rage she shows here, that she\nhas kept inside for fear of upsetting her parents.", "The idea that all suffering comes from attachment is reflected in\nGerda’s thoughts: she believes that now that her family has been taken from\nher, she can no longer be hurt. However, this conclusion is much like her\nmother’s belief that once the Nazis took their house they were safe, because\nthat was the worst injustice they could place upon them. Obviously, this is\na miscalculation on both of their parts, for the Nazis continue to prove\nthat they can always commit worse injustices. In a sense, though, the\nfreedom Gerda now feels is very real. The loss of responsibility to her\nparents allows her the audaciousness to behave in ways that she would not\nhave considered before, such as barging into the commander’s office at\nSosnowitz, which ultimately benefits her."], "4. There is a watch lying on the green carpet of the living room of\nmy childhood. The hands seem to stand motionless at 9:10, freezing time when\nit happened. ": ["The first lines of ", "All But My Life ", "reflect Gerda’s\nbelief that the Nazis stole her childhood, and that, in a way, time stopped\nfor her when her town was invaded. Many times throughout the book, Gerda\nwrites about feeling that her childhood ended when the Nazis first came to\nBielitz, and that at that moment her life changed dramatically. From the\nfirst days of the invasion, the burden of responsibility in her family was\nplaced on her shoulders. Jewish adults who freely walked the streets were\noften abducted or assaulted, so Gerda is the only member of her family who\ncan come and go from their house unchallenged, forcing her to assume\nresponsibility for many important decisions. Her role with her parents\nswitches after the invasion, for she becomes the caregiver in many respects,\ncausing her to feel that she must behave as an adult at all costs.", "The idea that time stops for Gerda when the invasion occurs is a\nnotion that she visits again in her epilogue. She says she experienced a\nbreak in her social development because she was not allowed to participate\nin ordinary adolescent activities during the six years of war. Her normal\nemotional growth was slowed. Although she had more horrifying experiences in\nher teenage years than most people see in a lifetime, she also had a huge\ngap in her social development. In a sense, time did stop for Gerda when the\nwar started, for after she was liberated she was still a girl of fifteen in\nmany respects. She writes that, at the age of twenty-one, she was afraid\nthat Kurt would attempt to kiss her, much as she feared Abek’s romantic\nattempts as a teenager."], "5. I had reached the summit, as I had dreamed I would in the dark\nyears of slavery, and there, beyond the sphere of human vision, we met and\nembraced. We would never be alone again. ": ["The last lines of the memoir summarize Gerda’s feelings about life and\nlove. She believes that no matter what happens in a person’s life, there is\nno pain or suffering that love cannot heal. While she does not believe she\nwill be rewarded in life just because she has suffered, she recognizes that\nin order to reap the rewards of a wonderful life, one must be willing to\nendure the pain of that life as well. Gerda has endured the suffering of the\nHolocaust (which she terms “the dark years of slavery”), and she now sees\nher love for Kurt as her reward. She believes that they are not merely\nengaged to be married, but that they are soul mates who connect on a level\nbeyond what we as humans can understand—perhaps even in a place where only\nGod makes the decisions. The idea that a power greater than either Kurt or\nGerda brought them together is implied when Gerda says that they met beyond\nthe sphere of human vision. This idea comforts Gerda, who has been through\nso much in the preceding years.", "For a woman like Gerda, who has lost her entire family and seen how\nreadily a person can lose everything in life, the idea that now she and Kurt\nwill never have to be alone again is radical. Gerda knows all too well how\neasy it is to lose someone you love—love in itself does not protect against\nthat loss. However, Gerda feels that her relationship with Kurt is not\nmerely physical, but spiritual as well. Although their bodies may be taken,\ntheir souls cannot be captured, and in that sense, Gerda and Kurt will\nremain together forever."]}}, "further_study": {"context_link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/allbutmylife/context/", "study-questions_link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/allbutmylife/study-questions/", "study-questions": {}, "context": ["\n", "Context", "\n", "\n", "All But My Life", " is Gerda Weissmann Klein’s memoir of her\nexperiences during World War II. Klein was born on May 8, 1924, in Bielitz (now\nBielsko), Poland. She remembers her childhood as being happy, even idyllic. The\nWeissmanns were a Jewish family, and their town had been part of the\nAustro-Hungarian Empire before 1919. Like most of the residents in the area, the\nWeissmann family was bilingual, speaking both Polish and German, and Klein’s older\nbrother, Arthur, studied English as well. Klein’s father, Julius, was a business\nexecutive who had lived in Bielitz for more than twenty years, and Helene, her\nmother, was born there, as were both Klein and Arthur. The family was horrified when\nGerman Nazi forces invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. Despite the fact that\nBritain and the United States declared war on Germany two days later, it took the\nNazis only eighteen days to conquer Poland.", "\n", "Soon afterward, the entire Jewish population of Bielitz was forced to register\nwith the police, and soon, sanctions were imposed against the Jews. First, they were\nrequired to turn in all gold, automobiles, bicycles, and radios. Many Jews were\nforced out of their homes, and the local temple was burned down. In October of 1939,\nall Jewish men between the ages of sixteen and fifty were forced to register,\nwhereupon they were sent in cattle cars to rebuild parts of Poland that had been\ndestroyed by Allied attacks. Klein’s brother was sent to the interior of Poland in\none of these transports. In December, the Weissmann family was forced to move into\nthe basement of their home, while the woman who had been their laundress took over\nthe main house. After Christmas, the Nazis restricted the local Jewish population’s\nfood supply by stamping their ration cards with the word “JEW,” entitling them to\nless than half the amount of food that non-Jews received. Their coal rations were\nalso cut, and they were forced to wear blue and white armbands and, later, yellow\nstars that identified them as Jews.", "\n", "Before the war began, Bielitz had a Jewish population of nearly 8,000 people.\nAs news of the German treatment of Jews reached them, however, more and more Jews\nfled to the Russian-occupied parts of Poland that had not been claimed during the\nGerman takeover. By the spring of 1940, the Jewish population in Bielitz had\ndwindled to little more than three hundred people, most of them children and the\nelderly. Like Klein’s brother, all of the young men had left in the transports. The\nyoung female population was declining as well, as more and more families left or\nsent their children out of the country. On April 19, 1942, all of the remaining Jews\nin Bielitz were ordered to move into a newly constructed Jewish ghetto. In May of\n1942, shortly after Klein’s eighteenth birthday, all Jews were required to register\nfor work. Those who did not comply were sent to Auschwitz, a nearby concentration\ncamp intended to enable the Nazis to kill those people who were deemed not useful to\nthe German cause. Soon, the Weissmann family was told that they would be sent to\ncamps in order to make Bielitz ", "Judenrein", "—free of Jews.

At the same time that her parents were taken to\nAuschwitz, Klein and many other young Polish people were taken to labor camps, where\nthey became slaves forced to work for the German war effort. As it became obvious\nthat Germany was losing the war, the Germans started dismantling the camps and\nforcing the prisoners onto marches that became known as “death marches” because of\ntheir extremely high mortality rate. In the winter of 1945, more than four thousand\nyoung women were forced onto a three-hundred-mile “death march” from a number of\nlabor camps in Germany and Poland to Czechoslovakia.

By the early 1880s,\nReconstruction, the plan to put the United States back together\nafter the war and integrate freed slaves into society, had hit shaky\nground, although it had not yet failed outright. As Twain worked\non his novel, race relations, which seemed to be on a positive path\nin the years following the Civil War, once again became strained.\nThe imposition of Jim Crow laws, designed to limit the power of\nblacks in the South in a variety of indirect ways, brought the beginning\nof a new, insidious effort to oppress. The new racism of the South,\nless institutionalized and monolithic, was also more difficult to\ncombat. Slavery could be outlawed, but when white Southerners enacted\nracist laws or policies under a professed motive of self-defense\nagainst newly freed blacks, far fewer people, Northern or Southern,\nsaw the act as immoral and rushed to combat it.", "Although Twain wrote the novel after slavery was abolished,\nhe set it several decades earlier, when slavery was still a fact\nof life. But even by Twain’s time, things had not necessarily gotten\nmuch better for blacks in the South. In this light, we might read\nTwain’s depiction of slavery as an allegorical representation of\nthe condition of blacks in the United States even ", "after", " the\nabolition of slavery. Just as slavery places the noble and moral\nJim under the control of white society, no matter how degraded that\nwhite society may be, so too did the insidious racism that arose\nnear the end of Reconstruction oppress black men for illogical and\nhypocritical reasons. In ", "Huckleberry Finn, ", "Twain,\nby exposing the hypocrisy of slavery, demonstrates how racism distorts\nthe oppressors as much as it does those who are oppressed. The result\nis a world of moral confusion, in which seemingly “good” white people\nsuch as Miss Watson and Sally Phelps express no concern about the\ninjustice of slavery or the cruelty of separating Jim from his family."], "Intellectual and Moral Education": ["By focusing on Huck’s education, ", "Huckleberry Finn", " fits\ninto the tradition of the bildungsroman: a novel depicting an individual’s\nmaturation and development. As a poor, uneducated boy, for all intents and\npurposes an orphan, Huck distrusts the morals and precepts of the\nsociety that treats him as an outcast and fails to protect him from abuse.\nThis apprehension about society, and his growing relationship with\nJim, lead Huck to question many of the teachings that he has received,\nespecially regarding race and slavery. More than once, we see Huck\nchoose to “go to hell” rather than go along with the rules and follow\nwhat he has been taught. Huck bases these decisions on his experiences,\nhis own sense of logic, and what his developing conscience tells\nhim. On the raft, away from civilization, Huck is especially free\nfrom society’s rules, able to make his own decisions without restriction.\nThrough deep introspection, he comes to his own conclusions, unaffected\nby the accepted—and often hypocritical—rules and values of Southern\nculture. By the novel’s end, Huck has learned to “read” the world\naround him, to distinguish good, bad, right, wrong, menace, friend,\nand so on. His moral development is sharply contrasted to the character\nof Tom Sawyer, who is influenced by a bizarre mix of adventure novels\nand Sunday-school teachings, which he combines to justify his outrageous\nand potentially harmful escapades."], "The Hypocrisy of “Civilized” Society": ["When Huck plans to head west at the end of the novel in\norder to escape further “sivilizing,” he is trying to avoid more\nthan regular baths and mandatory school attendance. Throughout the\nnovel, Twain depicts the society that surrounds Huck as little more\nthan a collection of degraded rules and precepts that defy logic.\nThis faulty logic appears early in the novel, when the new judge\nin town allows Pap to keep custody of Huck. The judge privileges\nPap’s “rights” to his son as his natural father over Huck’s welfare.\nAt the same time, this decision comments on a system that puts a\nwhite man’s rights to his “property”—his slaves—over the welfare\nand freedom of a black man. In implicitly comparing the plight of\nslaves to the plight of Huck at the hands of Pap, Twain implies\nthat it is impossible for a society that owns slaves to be just,\nno matter how “civilized” that society believes and proclaims itself\nto be. Again and again, Huck encounters individuals who seem good—Sally\nPhelps, for example—but who Twain takes care to show are prejudiced\nslave-owners. This shaky sense of justice that Huck repeatedly encounters\nlies at the heart of society’s problems: terrible acts go unpunished,\nyet frivolous crimes, such as drunkenly shouting insults, lead to\nexecutions. Sherburn’s speech to the mob that has come to lynch\nhim accurately summarizes the view of society Twain gives in ", "Huckleberry\nFinn", ": rather than maintain collective welfare, society\ninstead is marked by cowardice, a lack of logic, and profound selfishness."], "Guilt/shame": ["Huck experiences guilt and shame at various points throughout the novel, and these feelings force him into serious questions about morality. Huck’s guilt is largely tied to the religious morality he learned from Widow Douglas. Not long after he and Jim set out on their journey, Huck realizes that by helping Jim escape he has done harm to Jim’s owner, Miss Watson. He explains: “Conscience says to me, . . . ‘What did that poor old woman do to you, that you could treat her so mean?’ . . . I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead” (Chapter 16). Here Huck recognizes that has broken the Golden Rule of Christianity, which states, ", "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you", ". Huck remains conflicted until near the end of the book. The breaking point comes in Chapter 31, when he finds himself unable to pray. Huck realizes that in his heart he doesn’t believe Jim should be returned to slavery, and saying so in a prayer would result in him “playing double” and hence lying to God. When he finally resolves to help Jim escape for the last time, Huck banishes the last vestiges of guilt."], "Empathy": ["The theme of empathy is closely tied to the theme of guilt. Huck’s feelings of empathy help his moral development by enabling him to imagine what it’s like to be in someone else’s shoes. The theme of empathy first arises when Huck worries about the thieves he and Jim abandon on the wrecked steamboat. Once he’s escaped immediate danger, Huck grows concerned about the men: “I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for murderers, to be in such a fix.” Huck’s concern drives him to go and find help. Another significant example of empathy in the book comes in Chapter 23, when Huck wakes up to Jim “moaning and mourning to himself.” Huck imagines that Jim is feeling “low and homesick” because he’s thinking about his wife and children: “I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks for their’n. It don’t seem natural, but I reckon it’s so.” Despite the residual racism in this comment, Huck’s capacity for empathy has a strong humanizing power."], "Adventure": ["Ironically given the book’s title, the theme of “adventure” in ", "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn", " tends to conjure a sense of immaturity and childish make-believe. The book begins by pointing backward to its prequel, ", "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer", ", and the boyish exploits that resulted in Tom and Huck striking it rich. Chapter 2 continues this type of adventure, with Tom and his “Gang” of highwaymen. This spirit of adventure as play follows Huck beyond St. Petersburg. But the real-life situations Huck and Jim find themselves in frequently demonstrate that adventure is not what Tom and his games have made it out to be. The first of these situations occurs in Chapters 12 and 13, when Huck gets excited about a wrecked steamboat, but quickly flees upon discovering that three real murderers are hiding out there. By the end of the book, when Tom returns and tries to enforce an overly complicated and “romantical” plan for Jim’s escape, the very foundations of adventure have come to strike Huck as childish and unrealistic. Even so, Huck retains some lust for adventure, which he demonstrates when he declares his intent to leave Pikesville and “light out for the Territory.”"], "Money/wealth": ["Money does nothing but cause problems in this book. Huck complains that ever since he came into a significant sum of money at the end of ", "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer", ", he has had to suffer attempts to “sivilize” and educate him. In the early chapters of ", "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn", ", the biggest problem Huck’s money brings him is his father, Pap. Pap mainly wants access to Huck’s money so he can buy more alcohol, and his capacity for anger and violence becomes clear when Huck refuses to hand over any cash. Further money-related problems arise following the initial appearance of the duke and the dauphin, who swindle common townsfolk out of their money. Their scams cause anxiety for Huck and wreak havoc in all of the small towns they visit. The only time money seems like it might have a redemptive power is at the end of the novel, when Tom gives Jim forty dollars to pay his way back north. For Jim, money holds the promise of liberation. But given the many problems money has brought throughout the book, it seems unlikely that money alone will guarantee Jim his freedom."]}}, "quotes": {"link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/huckfinn/quotes/", "important_quotations_explained": {"The\nWidow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize\nme; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering\nhow dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and\nso when I couldn’t stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old\nrags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But\nTom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band\nof robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and\nbe respectable. So I went back. ": ["In these lines, which appear on the\nfirst page of the novel, Huck discusses events that have occurred\nsince the end of ", "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,", " the\nnovel in which he made his first appearance. Here, Huck establishes\nhis opposition to “sivilizing,” which seems natural for a thirteen-year-old\nboy rebelling against his parents and other authorities. Our initial\ninclination may be to laugh and dismiss Huck’s urges for freedom.\nAt the same time, however, we see that Huck’s problems with civilized\nsociety are based on some rather mature observations about the worth\nof that society. Huck goes on to associate civilization and respectability\nwith a childish game—Tom’s band of robbers, in which the participants\nare to pretend to be criminals. Under the influence of his friend,\nHuck gives in and returns to the Widow’s, but as the novel progresses,\nhis dislike for society reappears and influences the important decisions\nhe makes."], "I\nhadn’t had a bite to eat since yesterday, so Jim he got out some\ncorn-dodgers and buttermilk, and pork and cabbage and greens—there\nain’t nothing in the world so good when it’s cooked right—and whilst\nI eat my supper we talked and had a good time. . . .We said there\nwarn’t no home like a raft, after all. Other places do seem so cramped\nup and smothery, but a raft don’t. You feel mighty free and easy\nand comfortable on a raft. ": ["At this point in Chapter 18, Huck\nhas just escaped from the Grangerford-Shepherdson feud and is thoroughly\nsickened by society. Compared to the outrageous incidents onshore,\nthe raft represents a retreat from the outside world, the site of\nsimple pleasures and good companionship. Even the simple food Jim\noffers Huck is delicious in this atmosphere of freedom and comfort.\nHuck and Jim do not have to answer to anyone on the raft, and it\nrepresents a kind of utopian life for them. They try to maintain\nthis idyllic separation from society and its problems, but as the\nraft makes its way southward, unsavory influences from onshore repeatedly\ninvade the world of the raft. In a sense, Twain’s portrayal of life\non the raft and the river is a romantic one, but tempered by the\nrealistic knowledge that the evils and problems of the world are\ninescapable."], "It\nwas a close place. I took . . . up [the letter I’d written to Miss\nWatson], and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I’d\ngot to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied\na minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself: “All\nright then, I’ll go to hell”—and tore it up. It was awful thoughts\nand awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and\nnever thought no more about reforming. ": ["These lines from Chapter 31 describe\nthe moral climax of the novel. The duke and the dauphin have sold\nJim, who is being held in the Phelpses’ shed pending his return\nto his rightful owner. Thinking that life at home in St. Petersburg—even\nif it means Jim will still be a slave and Huck will be a captive\nof the Widow— would be better than his current state of peril far\nfrom home, Huck composes a letter to Miss Watson, telling her where\nJim is. When Huck thinks of his friendship with Jim, however, and\nrealizes that Jim will be sold down the river anyway, he decides\nto tear up the letter. The logical consequences of Huck’s action,\nrather than the lessons society has taught him, drive Huck. He decides\nthat going to “hell,” if it means following his gut and not society’s\nhypocritical and cruel principles, is a better option than going\nto everyone else’s heaven. This moment of decision represents Huck’s\ntrue break with the world around him. At this point, Huck decides\nto help Jim escape slavery once and for all. Huck also realizes\nthat he does not want to reenter the “sivilized” world: after all\nhis experiences and moral development on the river, he wants to\nmove on to the freedom of the West instead."], "Tom\ntold me what his plan was, and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen\nof mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man as mine\nwould, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied,\nand said we would waltz in on it. ": ["In this quotation from Chapter 34,\nwe see Huck once again swayed by his friend Tom. Although in practical\nterms it would be quite simple to break Jim out of the shed, Tom\ninsists on a more complicated plan with “style.” Dependent on Tom\nnot to blow his cover—at this point, Huck is pretending, for the\nbenefit of the Phelpses, to be Tom, while Tom is pretending to be\nhis brother Sid—Huck has to go along. Indeed, as we see, Tom’s return\nin the final chapters of the novel temporarily stops or reverses\nHuck’s development: Huck, in many ways, reverts to the status of\nTom’s follower that he occupied at the beginning of the novel. Nonetheless,\nHuck maintains his characteristic realistic outlook on the world,\nand his prediction that Tom’s plan could get them killed is more\naccurate than he knows."], "But\nI reckon I got to light out for the territory ahead of the rest,\nbecause Aunt Sally she’s going to adopt me and sivilize me, and\nI can’t stand it. I been there before. ": ["These lines are the last in the novel.\nBy the final chapter, most everything has been resolved: Jim is\nfree, Tom is on his way to recovering from a bullet wound, and Aunt\nSally has offered to adopt Huck. Although Huck has come to like\nSally and Silas, he knows they are still a part of the society he\nhas come to distrust and fear. Aunt Sally’s intentions for Huck\ncenter around the upbringing that society thinks every boy should\nhave: religion, clean clothes, education, and an indoctrination\nin right and wrong. Huck, however, has come to realize that the\nfirst two are useless and that, in reference to the third, he can\nprovide a much better version for himself than can society. The\n“territories,” the relatively unsettled western United States, will\noffer Huck an opportunity to be himself, in a world not yet “sivilized”\nand thus brimming with promise. Weary of his old life, Huck contemplates\nways to continue living with the same freedom he felt on the raft.\nHuck’s break from society is complete, and before the dust from\nhis adventures is fully settled, he is already scheming to detach\nhimself again."]}}, "further_study": {"context_link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/huckfinn/context/", "study-questions_link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/huckfinn/study-questions/", "study-questions": {"Huck Finn is\na thirteen-year-old boy. Why does Twain use a child as the center\nof consciousness in this book?": ["In using a child protagonist, Twain is able\nto imply a comparison between the powerlessness and vulnerability\nof a child and the powerlessness and vulnerability of a black man\nin pre–Civil War America. Huck and Jim frequently find themselves\nin the same predicaments: each is abused, each faces the threat\nof losing his freedom, and each is constantly at the mercy of adult\nwhite men. As we see in Huck’s moral dilemmas, however, Jim is also\nvulnerable to Huck, who, although he occupies the lowest rung of\nthe white social ladder, is white nonetheless. Twain also uses his\nchild protagonist to dramatize the conflict between societal or\nreceived morality on the one hand and a different kind of morality\nbased on intuition and experience on the other. As a boy, Huck is\na character who can develop morally, whose mind is still open and\nbeing formed, who does not take his principles and values for granted.\nBy tracing the education and experiences of a boy, Twain shows that\nconclusions about right and wrong that are based on logic and experience\noften stand at odds with the society’s rules and morals, which are\noften hypocritical rather than logical."]}, "context": ["\n", "Context", "\n", "Mark Twain was born Samuel\nLanghorne Clemens in the town of Florida, Missouri, in 1835.\nWhen he was four years old, his family moved to Hannibal, a town\non the Mississippi River much like the towns depicted in his two\nmost famous novels, ", "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer", " (1876)\nand ", "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn", " (1884).", "\n", "Clemens spent his young life in a fairly affluent family\nthat owned a number of household slaves.

Though early on Tom looks up to Huck as much older\nand wiser, by the end of the novel, Tom’s maturity has surpassed\nHuck’s. Tom’s personal growth is evident in his insistence, in the\nface of Huck’s desire to flee all social constraints, that Huck\nstay with the Widow Douglas and become civilized."], "Society’s Hypocrisy ": ["Twain complicates Tom’s position on the border between\nchildhood and adulthood by ridiculing and criticizing the values\nand practices of the adult world toward which Tom is heading. Twain’s\nharshest satire exposes the hypocrisy—and often the essential childishness—of\nsocial institutions such as school, church, and the law, as well\nas public opinion. He also mocks individuals, although when doing\nso he tends to be less biting and focuses on flaws of character\nthat we understand to be universal.", "Twain shows that social authority does not always operate\non wise, sound, or consistent principles and that institutions fall\nprey to the same kinds of mistakes that individuals do. In his depiction\nof families, Twain shows parental authority and constraint balanced by\nparental love and indulgence. Though she attempts to restrain and\npunish Tom, Aunt Polly always relents because of her love for her\nnephew. As the novel proceeds, a similar tendency toward indulgence\nbecomes apparent within the broader community as well. The community\nshows its indulgence when Tom’s dangerous adventures provoke an\noutpouring of concern: the community is perfectly ready to forgive\nTom’s wrongs if it can be sure of his safety. Twain ridicules the\nability of this collective tendency toward generosity and forgiveness\nto go overboard when he describes the town’s sentimental forgiveness\nof the villainous Injun Joe after his death.", "The games the children play often seem like attempts\nto subvert authority and escape from conventional society. Skipping\nschool, sneaking out at night, playing tricks on the teacher, and\nrunning away for days at a time are all ways of breaking the rules\nand defying authority. Yet, Twain shows us that these games can\nbe more conventional than they seem. Tom is highly concerned with\nconforming to the codes of behavior that he has learned from reading,\nand he outlines the various criteria that define a pirate, a Robin\nHood, or a circus clown. The boys’ obsession with superstition is\nlikewise an addiction to convention, which also mirrors the adult\nsociety’s focus on religion. Thus, the novel shows that adult existence\nis more similar to childhood existence than it might seem. Though\nthe novel is critical of society’s hypocrisy—that is, of the frequent\ndiscord between its values and its behavior—Twain doesn’t really\nadvocate subversion. The novel demonstrates the potential dangers\nof subverting authority just as it demonstrates the dangers of adhering\nto authority too strictly."], "Freedom through Social Exclusion ": ["St. Petersburg is an insular community in which outsiders\nare easily identified. The most notable local outsiders include\nHuck Finn, who fends for himself outside of any family structure\nbecause his father is a drunkard; Muff Potter, also a drunk; and\nInjun Joe, a malevolent half-breed. Despite the community’s clear\nseparation of outsiders from insiders, however, it seems to have\na strong impulse toward inclusiveness. The community tolerates the\ndrunkenness of a harmless rascal like Muff Potter, and Huck is more\nor less protected even though he exists on the fringes of society.\nTom too is an orphan who has been taken in by Aunt Polly out of\nlove and filial responsibility. Injun Joe is the only resident of\nSt. Petersburg who is completely excluded from the community. Only\nafter Injun Joe’s death are the townspeople able to transform him,\nthrough their manipulation of his memory, into a tolerable part\nof St. Petersburg society."], "Superstition in an Uncertain World ": ["Twain first explores superstition in the graveyard, where\nTom and Huck go to try out a magical cure for warts. From this point\nforward, superstition becomes an important element in all of the\nboys’ decision-making. The convenient aspect of Tom and Huck’s superstitious\nbeliefs is that there are so many of them, and they are so freely\ninterpretable; Tom and Huck can pick and choose whichever belief\nsuits their needs at the time. In this regard, Twain suggests, superstition\nbears a resemblance to religion—at least as the populace of St.\nPetersburg practices it.", "The humorousness of the boys’ obsession with witches,\nghosts, and graveyards papers over, to some extent, the real horror\nof the circumstances to which the boys are exposed: grave digging, murder,\nstarvation, and attempted mutilation. The relative ease with which\nthey assimilate these ghastly events into their childish world is\nperhaps one of the least realistic aspects of the novel. (If the\nnovel were written today, we might expect to read about the psychic\ndamage these extreme childhood experiences have done to these boys.)\nThe boys negotiate all this horror because they exist in a world\nsuspended somewhere between reality and make-believe.

The differences\nbetween the language of rich people and poor people, and between\nthe language of blacks and whites, often find expression in Twain’s\ndialogue.

Most\nevident in this dialogue with Ben Rogers is Tom’s consummate skill\nas an actor and his instinctive understanding of human behavior.\nIn these moments of prankish virtuosity, Tom always keeps one step\nahead of his victims, anticipating their reactions and cornering\nthem verbally into the response he desires. In painting these scenes,\nTwain draws on the American folk tradition of the trickster. (The\nBr’er Rabbit tales are another well-known example of this type of\nstory.)", "This episode also gives Twain a chance to advance the\nidea that certain values are as much a matter of convention as anything.\nThe moral with which Twain concludes this amusing scene is, “Work consists\nof whatever a body is ", "obliged", " to do, and . . .\n[p]lay consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do.” The arbitrariness\nof many conventions and the absurdity with which people desire things\njust because they are forbidden are facts of life that Twain scrutinizes again\nand again in the novel."], "Mr.\nWalters fell to “showing off,” with all sorts of official bustlings\nand activities. . . .

": ["This Sunday school scene from Chapter ", "4", " shows\nthe height of Twain’s leveling satire. While Twain makes explicit\njabs at the religious spirit and the structures of organized religion\nelsewhere in the novel, in this scene he directs his mockery toward\nhuman nature in a more generalized way. Much of the comic effect\nof this scene stems from the uniformity of the ridiculous behavior\nexhibited by teachers, students, boys, and girls. So strong is the\nhuman need to impress and to win approval that not even Judge Thatcher\nis exempt from the temptation to “show off.” Twain suggests that\nthe desire to stand out is universal, which means that in their\nefforts to distinguish themselves, people wind up all looking alike.", "For the adults, “showing off” means attempting to conceal\nthe rough edges of their schoolroom establishment, prettifying the\nSunday school so that the judge will get an enhanced sense of what\nis normal there.

If Tom had not sneaked out at night\nto carouse in the cemetery with Huck, he would never have been present\nto witness Dr. Robinson’s murder—as by all rights he should not\nhave been. Tom’s consistently bold and risky behavior puts him in\nthe position to save the day. Distinguishing himself from the conventional,\nrun-of-the-mill behavior that is accepted as the standard in his\ncommunity is an achievement that cuts both ways, as it makes Tom\nexceptional in both the good and the bad sense: an extreme character\nlike his is bound to lead either to greatness or to ignominy; as\nthe town puts it, he either will become president or hang."], "Huck\nFinn’s wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas’s\nprotection introduced him into society—no, dragged him into it,\nhurled him into it—and his sufferings were almost more than he could\nbear. The widow’s servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed….\nHe had to eat with knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and\nplate; he had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had\nto talk so properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth;\nwhithersoever he turned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut\nhim in and bound him hand and foot. ": ["This passage from Chapter ", "35", " is\nperhaps the clearest description of the way Huck’s life changes\nafter the Widow Douglas takes him in. Though told by the narrator\nrather than by Huck himself, the passage nevertheless renders the\nsituation as it appears through Huck’s eyes. This technique—rendering\na limited, childish point of view as though it were objective—is\none Twain uses throughout the novel to help us identify with the\nboys more than with the adults of the town. Much of the force of\nTwain’s heavily nostalgic narrative comes from the way it tugs at\nthe memories most adult readers have stored away, however deeply,\nof what it was like to be a child. We are thus able to view the\nevents of the novel from a double perspective: from a child’s point\nof view and from a wider perspective that sees the limitations of\nthat view and, most likely, its charm as well. The ordinary quality\nof the things the Widow Douglas compels Huck to do is meant to shock\nus out of our own assumptions. We realize afresh how unorthodox\nHuck’s life has actually been.

How does Tom\nSawyer change over the course of the story?": ["The beginning of the novel shows Tom as a\ncrafty, intelligent, and imaginative boy with excellent theatrical\nskills and an intuitive understanding of human nature. He expends\nhis immense personal resources mainly on tricks and games—on getting\ninto and then out of trouble in the real world and on elaborate\nflights of make-believe. He rarely takes anything seriously and\nseems to have no real conflicts.", "The murder of Dr. Robinson is the first serious conflict\nto present itself in the story, and we see Tom begin to change after\nhe witnesses it. His anxiety and guilt about Muff Potter’s fate\nare plain in the scenes in which he tries to get Huck to reconsider\ntheir vow to secrecy. The decision he finally makes is independent\nby every indication, however. Tom decides to follow his conscience\ndespite the ties that have bound him—his devotion to loyalty, superstition,\nand his personal safety.", "Tom’s disregard of his own interest prepares us for even\ngreater transformations in his character. In taking Becky Thatcher’s\npunishment, Tom exercises a preliminary heroism that conforms more\nto his storybook notions of chivalry and romance than it resolves\na real conflict. His chivalry and competence while he and Becky\nare trapped in the cave, however, represent a more meaningful, adult version\nof the same lesson in self-sacrifice and concern for others. When\nTom encourages Huck to return to the Widow Douglas’s house in the\nfinal scene, his transformation is complete. Though he does not\ncease to be a playful and fun-loving character, he has learned through\nexperiencing various dangers and mistakes to value the resources\nof home and community and to accept a certain measure of outside\nauthority."], "Analyze the\ncharacter of Aunt Polly and her relationship to Tom.": ["Though Tom and Aunt Polly position themselves\nas foes within the family—he as the troublemaker and she as the\ndisciplinarian—they are actually similar in many ways. Aunt Polly\nhas a humorous appreciation for Tom’s cleverness and his antics\nthat often prevents her from disciplining him as severely as she\nshould. At times, she tries to beat him at his own game—for example,\nwhen she tries to trick him into confessing that he has gone swimming\ninstead of to school. But, despite their superficially adversarial\nrelationship, there is a real bond of loyalty and love between Tom\nand Aunt Polly. The worst punishment she can inflict on Tom is to\ncry or be hurt by his behavior. Similarly, the misdeed of Tom’s\nthat she reacts to most strongly is his inconsiderate allowance\nof her suffering when she thinks that he is dead. Tom spies on the\nscene of the family’s mourning for him, and Aunt Polly finds the\npiece of bark with the message on it in Tom’s pocket—each character\nis extremely gratified by discovering indisputable evidence of the\nother’s affection. Aunt Polly thus embodies a more positive kind\nof authority than the rest of adult society because her strictness\nis balanced with real love and concern. Like Tom, she exhibits the\ntruly positive elements of social relations, without all the hypocrisy\nand insincerity."], " 3.

Even Aunt Polly dabbles\ninnocently in alcohol, which is likely the main ingredient of the\n“patent medicines” she administers to Tom (and which he, in turn,\nadministers to the cat).", "This obsession with alcohol fits into the larger themes\nof the novel because ", " is\nin many ways a story about pushing the limits of acceptable social\nbehavior. Muff Potter is more or less tolerated, largely because\nhe does very little harm. Huck’s father, Pap, is a more ambiguous\ncharacter because his debauchery has serious implications for his\nson. The issue of drinking also allows Twain to expand on the charges\nof hypocrisy that he levels against so many social proceedings.\nThe temperance violations offer a prime example of the kind of transgressions\npeople may hide under a surface of respectability. Even the schoolmaster,\nwho should be a role model for the children, turns out to be a heavy\ndrinker. Twain’s focus on performances, charlatanism, and various\nkinds of false advertising finds another instance in the quack medicines\nof which Aunt Polly is so enamored.

In 1949, the Cold\nWar had not yet escalated, many American intellectuals supported\ncommunism, and the state of diplomacy between democratic and communist\nnations was highly ambiguous. In the American press, the Soviet\nUnion was often portrayed as a great moral experiment. Orwell, however,\nwas deeply disturbed by the widespread cruelties and oppressions\nhe observed in communist countries, and seems to have been particularly\nconcerned by the role of technology in enabling oppressive governments\nto monitor and control their citizens.", "In ", "1984, ", "Orwell\nportrays the perfect totalitarian society, the most extreme realization\nimaginable of a modern-day government with absolute power. The title\nof the novel was meant to indicate to its readers in 1949 that\nthe story represented a real possibility for the near future: if\ntotalitarianism were not opposed, the title suggested, some variation\nof the world described in the novel could become a reality in only\nthirty-five years. Orwell portrays a state in which government monitors\nand controls every aspect of human life to the extent that even\nhaving a disloyal thought is against the law. As the novel progresses,\nthe timidly rebellious Winston Smith sets out to challenge the limits\nof the Party’s power, only to discover that its ability to control\nand enslave its subjects dwarfs even his most paranoid conceptions\nof its reach. As the reader comes to understand through Winston’s\neyes, The Party uses a number of techniques to control its citizens,\neach of which is an important theme of its own in the novel. These\ninclude:"], "Psychological Manipulation": ["The Party barrages its subjects with psychological stimuli\ndesigned to overwhelm the mind’s capacity for independent thought.\nThe giant telescreen in every citizen’s room blasts a constant stream\nof propaganda designed to make the failures and shortcomings of\nthe Party appear to be triumphant successes. The telescreens also\nmonitor behavior—everywhere they go, citizens are continuously reminded,\nespecially by means of the omnipresent signs reading ", "“BIG\nBROTHER IS WATCHING YOU,”", " that the authorities are scrutinizing\nthem. The Party undermines family structure by inducting children\ninto an organization called the Junior Spies, which brainwashes\n and encourages them to spy on their parents and report any instance\nof disloyalty to the Party. The Party also forces individuals to\nsuppress their sexual desires, treating sex as merely a procreative\nduty whose end is the creation of new Party members. The Party then\nchannels people’s pent-up frustration and emotion into intense,\nferocious displays of hatred against the Party’s political enemies.\nMany of these enemies have been invented by the Party expressly\nfor this purpose."], "Physical Control": ["In addition to manipulating their minds, the Party also\ncontrols the bodies of its subjects. The Party constantly watches\nfor any sign of disloyalty, to the point that, as Winston observes,\neven a tiny facial twitch could lead to an arrest. A person’s own\nnervous system becomes his greatest enemy. The Party forces its\nmembers to undergo mass morning exercises called the Physical Jerks,\nand then to work long, grueling days at government agencies, keeping\npeople in a general state of exhaustion. Anyone who does manage\nto defy the Party is punished and “reeducated” through systematic\nand brutal torture. After being subjected to weeks of this intense\ntreatment, Winston himself comes to the conclusion that nothing\nis more powerful than physical pain—no emotional loyalty or moral\nconviction can overcome it. By conditioning the minds of their victims\nwith physical torture, the Party is able to control reality, convincing\nits subjects that 2 + 2 = 5."], "Control of Information and History": ["The Party controls every source of information, managing\nand rewriting the content of all newspapers and histories for its\nown ends. The Party does not allow individuals to keep records of\ntheir past, such as photographs or documents. As a result, memories become\nfuzzy and unreliable, and citizens become perfectly willing to believe\nwhatever the Party tells them. By controlling the present, the Party\nis able to manipulate the past. And in controlling the past, the\nParty can justify all of its actions in the present."], "Technology": ["By means of telescreens and hidden microphones across\nthe city, the Party is able to monitor its members almost all of\nthe time. Additionally, the Party employs complicated mechanisms\n(", "1984", " was written\nin the era before computers) to exert large-scale control on economic\nproduction and sources of information, and fearsome machinery to\ninflict torture upon those it deems enemies. ", "1984", " reveals\nthat technology, which is generally perceived as working toward\nmoral good, can also facilitate the most diabolical evil."], "Language as Mind Control": ["One of Orwell’s most important messages in ", "1984", " is\nthat language is of central importance to human thought because\nit structures and limits the ideas that individuals are capable\nof formulating and expressing. If control of language were centralized\nin a political agency, Orwell proposes, such an agency could possibly\nalter the very structure of language to make it impossible to even\nconceive of disobedient or rebellious thoughts, because there would\nbe no words with which to think them. This idea manifests itself\nin the language of Newspeak, which the Party has introduced to replace English.\nThe Party is constantly refining and perfecting Newspeak, with the\nultimate goal that no one will be capable of conceptualizing anything\nthat might question the Party’s absolute power.", "Interestingly, many of Orwell’s ideas about language as\na controlling force have been modified by writers and critics seeking\nto deal with the legacy of colonialism. During colonial times, foreign powers\ntook political and military control of distant regions and, as a\npart of their occupation, instituted their own language as the language\nof government and business. Postcolonial writers often analyze or\nredress the damage done to local populations by the loss of language\nand the attendant loss of culture and historical connection."], "Loyalty": ["In ", "1984", ", the Party seeks to ensure that the only kind of loyalty possible is loyalty to the Party. The reader sees examples of virtually every kind of loyalty, from the most fundamental to the most trivial, being destroyed by the Party. Neighbors and coworkers inform on one another, and Mr. Parson’s own child reports him to the Thought Police. Winston’s half-remembered marriage to his wife fell apart with no sense of loyalty. Even the relationship between customer and merchant is perverted as Winston learns that the man who has sold him the very tools of his resistance and independence was a member of the Thought Police. Winston’s relationship with Julia is the ultimate loyalty that is tested by the events of the book. In Book Two: Chapter VII, Winston tells Julia, “if they could make me stop loving you—that would be the real betrayal.” In the end, the Party does make Winston stop loving Julia and love Big Brother instead, the only form of loyalty allowed."], "Resistance and Revolution": ["In ", "1984, ", "Winston explores increasingly risky and significant acts of resistance against the Party. In Book One: Chapter VII, Winston observes that “rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflection of the voice; at the most, an occasional whispered word.” Winston builds up these minor rebellions by committing personal acts of disobedience such as keeping a journal and buying a decorative paperweight. Eventually he escalates his rebellion through his sexual relationship with Julia. The relationship is a double rebellion, as it includes the thoughtcrime of desire. Winston doesn’t believe his actions or the actions of others will lead to the destruction of the Party within his lifetime, but before he is caught by the Thought Police he holds out hope that in the future someone will be able to look back at Winston’s time from a world that is free.", "Winston’s most concrete hope for actual revolution against the Party lies with the social underclass of the city, called the proles. He observes that the proles already have far greater numbers than the Party and that the proles have the strength to carry out a revolution if they could ever organize themselves. The problem is that the proles have been subject to such serious poverty for so long that they are unable to see past the goal of survival. The very notion of trying to build a better world is too much for them to contemplate. All of these observations are set against the backdrop of the Party’s own identity as the product of revolution. According to Winston, the Party was created during the mid-1960s during a revolution that overthrew the existing British social order. The Party claims that the Revolution has not yet ended and that it will be fulfilled once they have complete control."], "Independence and Identity": ["While the Party’s primary tool for manipulating the populace is the control of history, they also control independence and identity. For example, the basic traits of establishing one’s identity are unavailable to Winston and the other citizens of Oceania. Winston does not know how old he is. He does not know whether he is married or not. He does not know whether his mother is alive or dead. None of his childhood memories are reliable, because he has no photos or documents to help him sort real memories from imagined ones. Instead of being unique individuals with specific, identifying details, every member of the Outer Party is identical. All Party members wear the same clothing, smoke the same brand of cigarettes, drink the same brand of gin, and so forth. As such, forming a sense of individual identity is not only psychologically challenging, but logistically difficult."]}}, "quotes": {"link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/1984/quotes/", "important_quotations_explained": {" war\nis peace   freedom is slavery   ignorance is strength  ": ["These words are the official slogans\nof the Party, and are inscribed in massive letters on the white\npyramid of the Ministry of Truth, as Winston observes in Book One,\nChapter I. Because it is introduced so early in the novel, this\ncreed serves as the reader’s first introduction to the idea of doublethink.\nBy weakening the independence and strength of individuals’ minds\nand forcing them to live in a constant state of propaganda-induced\nfear, the Party is able to force its subjects to accept anything\nit decrees, even if it is entirely illogical—for instance, the Ministry\nof Peace is in charge of waging war, the Ministry of Love is in\ncharge of political torture, and the Ministry of Truth is in charge\nof doctoring history books to reflect the Party’s ideology.", "That the national slogan of Oceania is equally contradictory\nis an important testament to the power of the Party’s mass campaign\nof psychological control. In theory, the Party is able to maintain\nthat “War Is Peace” because having a common enemy keeps the people of\nOceania united. “Freedom Is Slavery” because, according to the Party,\nthe man who is independent is doomed to fail. By the same token,\n“Slavery Is Freedom,” because the man subjected to the collective\nwill is free from danger and want. “Ignorance Is Strength” because\nthe inability of the people to recognize these contradictions cements\nthe power of the authoritarian regime."], "Who\ncontrols the past controls the future. Who controls the present\ncontrols the past. ": ["This Party slogan appears twice in the\nnovel, once in Book One, Chapter III, when Winston is thinking about\nthe Party’s control of history and memory, and once in Book Three,\nChapter II, when Winston, now a prisoner in the Ministry of Love,\ntalks to O’Brien about the nature of the past. The slogan is an\nimportant example of the Party’s technique of using false history\nto break down the psychological independence of its subjects. Control\nof the past ensures control of the future, because the past can\nbe treated essentially as a set of conditions that justify or encourage\nfuture goals: if the past was idyllic, then people will act to re-create\nit; if the past was nightmarish, then people will act to prevent\nsuch circumstances from recurring. The Party creates a past that\nwas a time of misery and slavery from which it claims to have liberated\nthe human race, thus compelling people to work toward the Party’s\ngoals.", "The Party has complete political power in the present,\nenabling it to control the way in which its subjects think about\nand interpret the past: every history book reflects Party ideology,\nand individuals are forbidden from keeping mementos of their own\npasts, such as photographs and documents. As a result, the citizens\nof Oceania have a very short, fuzzy memory, and are willing to believe\nanything that the Party tells them. In the second appearance of\nthis quote, O’Brien tells Winston that the past has no concrete\nexistence and that it is real only in the minds of human beings.\nO’Brien is essentially arguing that because the Party’s version\nof the past is what people believe, that past, though it has no\nbasis in real events, has become the truth."], "In\nthe end the Party would announce that two and two made five, and\nyou would have to believe it. It was inevitable that they should\nmake that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded\nit. Not merely the validity of experience, but the very existence\nof external reality was tacitly denied by their philosophy. ": ["This quote occurs in Book One, Chapter\nVII, as Winston looks at a children’s history book and marvels at\nthe Party’s control of the human mind. These lines play into the\n theme of psychological manipulation. In this case, Winston considers\nthe Party’s exploitation of its fearful subjects as a means to suppress\nthe intellectual notion of objective reality. If the universe exists\nonly in the mind, and the Party controls the mind, then the Party\ncontrols the universe. As Winston thinks, “For, after all, how do\nwe know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity\nworks? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the\nexternal world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is\ncontrollable—what then?” The mathematical sentence 2\n+ 2 = 5 thus becomes a motif linked to the theme of\npsychological independence. Early in the novel, Winston writes that\n“Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four.” The\nmotif comes full circle at the end of the novel after the torture\nWinston suffers in the Ministry of Love breaks his soul; he sits\nat the Chestnut Tree Café and traces “2 + 2 = 5” in\nthe dust on his table."], "And\nwhen memory failed and written records were falsified—when that\nhappened, the claim of the Party to have improved the conditions\nof human life had got to be accepted, because there did not exist,\nand never again could exist, any standard against which it could\nbe tested. ": ["This quote from Book One, Chapter VIII,\nemphasizes how one’s understanding of the past affects one’s attitude\nabout the present. Winston has just had a frustrating conversation\nwith an old man about life before the Revolution, and he realizes\nthat the Party has deliberately set out to weaken people’s memories\nin order to render them unable to challenge what the Party claims\nabout the present. If no one remembers life before the Revolution,\nthen no one can say that the Party has failed mankind by forcing\npeople to live in conditions of poverty, filth, ignorance, and hunger.\nRather, the Party uses rewritten history books and falsified records\nto prove its good deeds."], "And\nperhaps you might pretend, afterwards, that it was only a trick\nand that you just said it to make them stop and didn’t really mean\nit. But that isn’t true. At the time when it happens you do mean\nit. You think there’s no other way of saving yourself and you’re\nquite ready to save yourself that way. You want it to happen to\nthe other person. You don’t give a damn what they suffer. All you\ncare about is yourself. ": ["Julia speaks these lines to Winston\nin Book Three, Chapter VI, as they discuss what happened to them\nin Room 101. She tells him that she wanted\nher torture to be shifted to him, and he responds that he felt exactly\nthe same way. These acts of mutual betrayal represent the Party’s\nfinal psychological victory. Soon after their respective experiences\nin Room 101, Winston and Julia are set free\nas they no longer pose a threat to the Party. Here, Julia says that\ndespite her efforts to make herself feel better, she knows that\nin order to save herself she really did want the Party to torture\nWinston. In the end, the Party proves to Winston and Julia that\nno moral conviction or emotional loyalty is strong enough to withstand\ntorture. Physical pain and fear will always cause people to betray\ntheir convictions if doing so will end their suffering. ", "Winston comes to a similar conclusion during his own stint\nat the Ministry of Love, bringing to its culmination the novel’s\ntheme of physical control: control over the body ultimately grants\nthe Party control over the mind. As with most of the Party’s techniques,\nthere is an extremely ironic strain of doublethink running underneath: self-love\nand self-preservation, the underlying components of individualism\nand independence, lead one to fear pain and suffering, ultimately\ncausing one to accept the principles of anti-individualist collectivism\nthat allows the Party to thrive."]}}, "further_study": {"context_link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/1984/context/", "study-questions_link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/1984/study-questions/", "study-questions": {" 1984 is\nfull of images and ideas that do not directly affect the plot, but\nnevertheless attain thematic importance.

Winston\nconceives of the singing prole woman as an incubator for future\nrebels; she symbolizes for him the eventual overthrow of the Party\nby the working class. The St. Clement’s Church picture is a double\nsymbol. For Winston it symbolizes a stolen past, but it also symbolizes\nthe Party’s complete power and betrayal of humanity, since\nthe picture hides the telescreen by which the Party monitors Winston\nwhen he believes himself to be safe. The St. Clement’s song is a\nmysterious, ominous, and enigmatic relic of the past for Winston\nand Julia. Its ending—“Here comes the chopper to chop off your head!”—foreshadows\ntheir eventual capture and torture.", "Winston’s paperweight is another symbol of the past, but\nit also comes to represent a kind of temporal stasis in which Winston\ncan dream without fear, imagining himself floating inside the glass\nwalls of the paperweight with his mother. The phrase “the place\nwhere there is no darkness” works as another symbol of escapist\nhope throughout the novel, as Winston recalls the dream in which O’Brien\ntells him about this place and says that they will meet there one\nday. The phrase therefore orients Winston toward the end of the novel,\nwhen the phrase becomes bitterly ironic: the place where there is\nno darkness is the Ministry of Love, where the lights remain on\nin the prisons all day and all night."], "Discuss the\nidea of doublethink. How important is doublethink to the Party’s\ncontrol of Oceania? How important is it to Winston’s brainwashing?": ["One of the most compelling aspects of ", " is\nOrwell’s understanding of the roles that thought and language play\nin rebellion and control. In Newspeak, Orwell invents a language\nthat will make rebellion impossible, because the words to conceive\nof such an action cease to exist. Doublethink, the ability to maintain\ntwo contradictory ideas in one’s head simultaneously and believe\nthem both to be true, functions as a psychological mechanism that\nexplains people’s willingness to accept control over their memories\nand their past. Doublethink is crucial to the Party’s control of\nOceania, because it enables the Party to alter historical records\nand pass off these distorted accounts as authentic. The brainwashed\npopulace no longer recognizes contradictions. Instead, it accepts\nthe Party’s version of the past as accurate, even though that representation\nmay change from minute to minute.", "Emmanuel Goldstein’s manifesto even suggests that doublethink is\nstrongest among the powerful Inner Party members who convince themselves\nthat they act for Big Brother, even though they know that Big Brother\nis a myth. Doublethink is equally crucial to Winston’s gradual conversion\nto loving Big Brother because it enables him to accept his torturers’\nwords as true, even though his own fading memories—of the photograph\nof the three Party traitors, for instance—contradict them."], "Describe Julia’s\ncharacter as it relates to Winston.

At the same time, however, the Puritans also thought of the American continent as somehow sacred, a new promised land. As white Americans began to explore westward, these two attitudes remained at the forefront of the American imagination. Ideas of the American West have become an important part of our literature and mythology; they are pervasive in the American mind. For as long as white Americans have lived on this continent, they have regarded the unsettled West with a mixture of fear and excitement. It has been seen as a place of possibility but also of peril: a proving ground.", "\n", "It is obvious, of course, that ", "the history of the exploration and settlement of the country west of the original colonies", "--with its attendant violence and savagery towards the Native Americans who already lived there--is the history of the United States. Even the original colonies, as an unknown and uncivilized frontier for the European colonists, were an expression of Western expansion. The great moments in the history of the West are the great moments in American history: the Louisiana Purchase of western lands in 1803; the Lewis and Clark overland expedition to the Pacific Northwest from 1804-1806; the mapmaking and explorations of John C. Fremont in the late 1830s and 1840s; and the 1849 gold rush that brought Americans westward in unprecedented numbers. The gold rush, especially, solidified in the American mind an image of the West as a place of vast possibility. And other facets were being added to the vision: the West was a place, far away from civilization, of violence and lawlessness; a place relatively devoid of women and children, dominated by the men who explored and settled it first, governed by their codes of strength and toughness; a place of lonely and awesome beauty. The West was, as the literary critic Jane Tompkins has written, \"a symbol of freedom, and of the opportunity for conquest.\"", "\n", "While the boundaries of any geographical area that might be known as the \"West\" have changed dramatically (for the Puritans, Western Massachusetts was quite far enough West), the popular imagination began to delineate areas that represented the ideas they associated with the West. This was--again, in Tompkins' words--\"the West of the desert, of mountains and prairies.\" The West was the area in which cowboys roamed along the great cattle trails. This West certainly existed. And the idea of the West as a breeding ground for American traits of individualism and risk-taking, as a place of possibility where a poor man might become rich, is surely an idea authenticated by history. But it must be said that the West as it is popularly imagined--of cowboys and Indians, of \"big-sky\" country--was to a great extent a product of an industry and a genre that has defined American culture in the past century: the Western.", "\n", "Movies set within the Western experience comprise a significant percentage of American films. Everyone has seen these movies, and recognizes their brave but antisocial heroes, their lawless villains, the sweep of violins while a horse rides off into a sunset. For a generation of Americans, the cowboys they saw in the movies became symbols of American masculinity. The Western novel, too, has been a popular form since the first nineteenth-century dime-store pamphlets described, in terms so melodramatic and exaggerated as to be formulaic, the exploits of the great heroes of the West. In the twentieth century, immensely popular novelists like Zane Grey and Louis L'Amour have maintained the tradition of the Western novel (and in a much better written form).", "\n", "The end of the twentieth century saw a revision of popular attitudes about the West, as scholars in many disciplines began to question previously accepted assumptions about America's historical and cultural heritage. New attention, for instance, was given to the appalling treatment of Native Americans during the Western expansion, and how this treatment was reflected in the Western movies that either vilified or trivialized the Native American characters. Where in earlier generations the gunfighting past of the American West was glorified--a symbol of American traditions of individualism and roughshod justice--many at the end of the twentieth century began to ask questions about the harmful impact of that violence to our culture and to the men who used violence to justify their moral codes. It is telling that the best American western of the 1990s was Clint Eastwood's \"Unforgiven\" (1993), an anti-Western, a story about the human casualties and psychological scarring of gunfights. And it is telling that the great writer of Western novels at the end of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first is Cormac McCarthy.", "\n", "Indeed, McCarthy is most probably the greatest writer of Western novels in American history, to such a degree that his novels also transcend the \"Western\" genre.

McCarthy writes about the dark and unseen side of the Western idea: you will read in McCarthy's novels what you will never see in most Western movies, stories about tragedy, cruelty, and blood without a heroic or redemptive ending. The irony of ", "All the Pretty Horses", " is that it exposes characters desperately trying to inhabit the cowboy myth--to subscribe to the cowboy code of stoicism, understated nobility and great physical skill--in the realities of exploration in a savage and uncivilized land.

The older characters in the play are haunted by death--the Countess has lost a husband and is aging herself; Helena's father has passed away; Lafew is infirm; Diana's mother is, appropriately enough, a Widow; and the King is near death as the play begins. In a sense, the shadow of death makes this a very realistic work, since the younger generation--Helena, Diana, and Bertram--are at an age for marriage, and, given the life expectancy of Shakespeare's time, few people lived to be grandparents. But if the old people are haunted by death, they are also graced with wisdom and discernment: they all see through Parolles, perceive Helena's worth, and condemn Bertram. The younger generation, while not unsympathetic, lacks this wisdom: Helena is intelligent, but her love for Bertram is misguided; Diana is naive and inexperienced; Bertram is callow, arrogant and spoiled. The prospect of these characters inheriting France from the gentle wisdom of the Countess, the King and Lafew is a disheartening one."], "Discuss the play's perspective on relations between the sexes.": ["Like all of Shakespeare's comedies, the plot of ", " is primarily concerned with bringing young people together in marriage. It is not, however, a ", " play: relations between the sexes are relentlessly demystified. The good characters, like Helena and Diana, are ", " defending female virtue and monogamy against the lechery of Parolles and the adulterous advances of Bertram, but they are cynical about the opposite sex nevertheless. Helena is \"in love\" with Bertram, but she seems unconcerned by the fact that he does not love her back, busying herself instead with trapping him into marrying--first through the King's command, and then by tricking him into sleeping with her. \"But, O strange men!\" she says, anticipating her night with Bertram. \"That can such sweet use make of what they hate, / When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts / Defiles the pitchy night; so lust doth play / With what it loathes for that which is away.\" (IV.i.21-25) In other words, men will sleep with anyone, and cannot tell one woman from another. Helena takes advantage of this animal-like trait, and we applaud her practicality, but we cannot say that her ultimate union with Bertram has anything to do with romance. Marriage in this play is the result of determination on one side, and lust and foolishness on the other."], "Discuss Parolles' role in the play.": ["Bertram's companion is, by general agreement, a boastful, cowardly, treacherous character. Bertram's unpleasant qualities have occasioned some critics to argue that it is Parolles who leads Bertram astray--that he is the villain of the piece. This, however, elevates Parolles higher than he deserves, raising him to the level of true Shakespearen evil, akin to Iago in ", " or Edmund in ", " These villains are masters of deception, but Parolles is no such thing--he is eminently transparent, and beginning with Lafew in the second act, every character of good will sees through him. Bertram's failure to do the same is not a reflection of Parolles' evil genius, but rather Bertram's own blindness. Indeed, Parolles' villainy is transformed into comedy in the long scene where he is made to believe that he is a prisoner, and, blindfolded, proceeds to betray all his supposed friends while they look on and laugh. After that point, he is harmless, and Shakespeare will even rehabilitate him, bringing him back to Rousillon as a servant to Lafew, and giving him a role as a witness in the final scene.

The son of a successful middle-class glove-maker, Shakespeare attended grammar school, but his formal education proceeded no further. In 1582, he married an older woman, Anne Hathaway, and had three children with her. Around 1590 he left his family behind and traveled to London to work as an actor and playwright. Public and critical success quickly followed, and Shakespeare eventually became the most popular playwright in England and part owner of the Globe Theater. His career bridged the reigns of Elizabeth I (ruled 1558-1603) and James I (ruled 1603-1625); he was a favorite of both monarchs. Indeed, James granted Shakespeare's company the greatest possible compliment by endowing them with the status of king's players. Wealthy and renowned, Shakespeare retired to Stratford, and died in 1616 at the age of fifty-two. At the time of Shakespeare's death, such luminaries as Ben Jonson hailed him as the apogee of Renaissance theatre.", "\n", "Shakespeare's works were collected and printed in various editions in the century following his death, and by the early eighteenth century his reputation as the greatest poet ever to write in English was well established. The unprecedented admiration garnered by his works led to a fierce curiosity about Shakespeare's life; but the paucity of surviving biographical information has left many details of Shakespeare's personal history shrouded in mystery. Some people have concluded from this fact that Shakespeare's plays in reality were written by someone else--Francis Bacon and the Earl of Oxford are the two most popular candidates--but the evidence for this claim is overwhelmingly circumstantial, and the theory is not taken seriously by many scholars.", "\n", "In the absence of definitive proof to the contrary, Shakespeare must be viewed as the author of the 37 plays and 154 sonnets that bear his name.

Whereas war novels before ", "All Quiet\non the Western Front", " tended to romanticize what war was\nlike, emphasizing ideas such as glory, honor, patriotic duty, and\nadventure, ", "All Quiet on the Western Front", " sets\nout to portray war as it was actually experienced, replacing the\nromantic picture of glory and heroism with a decidedly unromantic\nvision of fear, meaninglessness, and butchery. In many ways, World\nWar I demanded this depiction more than any war before it—it completely\naltered mankind’s conception of military conflict with its catastrophic\nlevels of carnage and violence, its battles that lasted for months,\nand its gruesome new technological advancements (e.g., machine guns,\npoison gas, trenches) that made killing easier and more\nimpersonal than ever before. Remarque’s novel dramatizes these aspects\nof World War I and portrays the mind-numbing terror and savagery\nof war with a relentless focus on the physical and psychological\ndamage that it occasions. At the end of the novel, almost every major\ncharacter is dead, epitomizing the war’s devastating effect on the generation\nof young men who were forced to fight it."], "The Effect of War on the Soldier": ["Because ", "All Quiet on the Western Front", " is\nset among soldiers fighting on the front, one of its main focuses\nis the ruinous effect that war has on the soldiers who fight it.\nThese men are subject to constant physical danger, as they could\nliterally be blown to pieces at any moment. This intense physical\nthreat also serves as an unceasing attack on the nerves, forcing\nsoldiers to cope with primal, instinctive fear during every waking\nmoment. Additionally, the soldiers are forced to live in appalling\nconditions—in filthy, waterlogged ditches full of rats and decaying\ncorpses and infested with lice. They frequently go without food\nand sleep, adequate clothing, or sufficient medical care. They are\nforced, moreover, to deal with the frequent, sudden deaths of their\nclose friends and comrades, often in close proximity and in extremely\nviolent fashion. Remarque portrays the overall effect of these conditions\nas a crippling overload of panic and despair. The only way for soldiers\nto survive is to disconnect themselves from their feelings, suppressing\ntheir emotions and accepting the conditions of their lives.", "In Remarque’s view, this emotional disconnection has a\nhugely destructive impact on a soldier’s humanity; Paul, for instance, becomes\nunable to imagine a future without the war and unable to remember\nhow he felt in the past. He also loses his ability to speak to his\nfamily. Soldiers no longer pause to mourn fallen friends and comrades;\nwhen Kemmerich is on his deathbed, at the beginning of the novel,\nthe most pressing question among his friends is who will inherit\nhis boots. Among the living soldiers, however, Remarque portrays\nintense bonds of loyalty and friendship that spring up as a result\nof the shared experience of war. These feelings are the only romanticized\nelement of the novel and are virtually the only emotions that preserve\nthe soldiers’ fundamental humanity."], "Nationalism and Political Power": ["In many ways, the precipitating cause of World War I was\nthe ethic of nationalism, the idea that competing nation-states\nwere a fundamental part of existence, that one owed one’s first\nloyalty to one’s nation, and that one’s national identity was the\nprimary component of one’s overall identity. The ethic of nationalism\nwas not new, but it had reached new heights of intensity in the\nnineteenth century, and this fervor generally carried over into\nthe start of World War I.", "In its depiction of the horror of war, ", "All Quiet\non the Western Front", " presents a scathing critique of the\nidea of nationalism, showing it to be a hollow, hypocritical ideology,\na tool used by those in power to control a nation’s populace. Paul\nand his friends are seduced into joining the army by nationalist\nideas, but the experience of fighting quickly schools them in nationalism’s\nirrelevance in the face of the war’s horrors. The relative\nworthlessness on the battlefield of the patriots Kantorek and Himmelstoss\naccentuates the inappropriateness of outmoded ideals in modern warfare.\nRemarque illustrates that soldiers on the front fight not for the\nglory of their nation but rather for their own survival; they kill\nto keep from being killed. Additionally, Paul and his friends do\nnot consider the opposing armies to be their real enemies; in their\nview, their real enemies are the men in power in their own nation,\nwho they believe have sacrificed them to the war simply to increase\ntheir own power and glory."]}}, "quotes": {"link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/allquiet/quotes/", "important_quotations_explained": {"This\nbook is to be neither an accusation nor a confession, and least\nof all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who\nstand face to face with it.

": ["This passage is the epigraph\nto the novel, telling the reader what the book is intended to be\nand mapping out some of its basic stylistic and thematic ground.\nThe statement that the book is not “an adventure” separates it from\nmost war novels in that it will dispense with elements of romance\nand excitement in favor of a stark, unsentimental presentation.\nThe clarification that “death is not an adventure to those who stand\nface to face with it” suggests that books that tell stories of war\nas though they were exciting adventures do not do justice to the\nactual experience of soldiers. Death may be an adventure to the\nreader, sitting comfortably at home, but it is anything but that\nto the soldier who is actually confronted with the possibility of\nbeing blown to pieces at any moment. The epigraph also declares\nthat the book will be the story of an entire generation, one “destroyed\nby the war” even if not actually killed off by it. The epigraph\nthus opens the novel’s exploration of the effect of the war on those\nwho fought it; war is a transforming force that not only injures\nand traumatizes but also annihilates selfhood.", "There is friction, however, between the claim that the\nbook will attempt “simply” to depict this annihilation and the claim\nthat the book is not an accusation. ", "All Quiet on the Western\nFront", " certainly takes a strong critical position against\nthe war and against nationalist and ignorant figures like Kantorek\nand Himmelstoss. Perhaps the meaning of the epigraph is that the\nbook will let events speak for themselves since they have not been\nembellished for the sake of some political goal. Still, it is hard\nto see the one-dimensional Kantorek as anything other than the object\nof accusation. The friction between realism and antiwar fervor found\nin the epigraph parallels an aesthetic tension in the novel, as\nRemarque tries to reconcile his hatred of the war with a need to\ncreate realistic characters who are more than mere punching bags."], "For\nus lads of eighteen they ought to have been mediators and guides\nto the world of maturity . . . to the future . . . in our hearts\nwe trusted them. The idea of authority, which they represented,\nwas associated in our minds with a greater insight and a more humane\nwisdom. But the first death we saw shattered this belief. We had\nto recognize that our generation was more to be trusted than theirs.\n. . . The first bombardment showed us our mistake, and under it\nthe world as they had taught it to us broke in pieces. ": ["This quotation from Chapter One constitutes\nPaul’s first and most direct exploration of how the older generation\nbetrays the younger generation by convincing them to sacrifice their\nlives for the empty ideals of patriotism and honor. Paul says that\nauthority figures from the older generation—parents, leaders, teachers\nsuch as Kantorek—should have been wise guides to the future and\nthat, as boys, the young soldiers all assumed that they would be.\nBut after the war began, the soldiers realized that the older generation\nhad failed them, and Paul reacts to this failure with anger and\ndisdain. He emphasizes that the older generation, which is constantly\nready to criticize and ostracize young men for signs of cowardice\nor unpatriotic behavior but has not itself experienced the war,\nhas no understanding of what the fighting is actually like. The\nyounger generation must look to themselves to determine what is\ntrue and right because the older generation has proved itself incapable\nof teaching them."], "At\nthe sound of the first droning of the shells we rush back, in one\npart of our being, a thousand years.

It is this other, this second sight in us, that has thrown\nus to the ground and saved us, without our knowing how. . . . We\nmarch up, moody or good-tempered soldiers—we reach the zone where\nthe front begins and become on the instant human animals. ": ["With these words, Paul describes, in\nChapter Four, the psychological transformation that soldiers undergo\nwhen heading into battle. Paul observes this phenomenon as he and\nhis comrades near the front on their mission to lay barbed wire.\nThey cease to become men (“moody or good-tempered soldiers”) and\ninstead become beasts (“human animals”). To survive, it is necessary\nfor the soldiers to sacrifice the thoughtful and analytical parts\nof their minds and rely instead wholly on animal instinct. Paul\ndescribes men who have been walking thoughtlessly along and suddenly\nthrown themselves to the ground just in time to avoid a shell, without\nhaving been consciously aware that a shell was approaching and without\nhaving intended to leap to avoid it. Paul calls this instinct a\n“second sight” and says that it is the only thing that enables soldiers\nto survive a battle. In this way, Paul implies that battles are\nanimalistic and even subhuman, a large aspect of the devastation\nthat the war wreaks on a soldier’s humanity."], "Just\nas we turn into animals when we go up to the line . . . so we turn\ninto wags and loafers when we are resting. . . .

Martens\nhas no legs anymore, Meyer is dead, Max is dead, Beyer is dead, Hammerling\nis dead . . . it is a damnable business, but what has it to do with\nus now—we live. ": ["In this grim passage from Chapter Seven,\nPaul discusses the psychological process of how a soldier disconnects\nhimself from his feelings in order to survive the terror of the\nwar. After the bloody fighting, Paul and his friends are lying about\nenjoying a moment of relaxation and leisure, and have pushed their\nrecent horrific experiences out of their minds. Paul says that terror\ncan be survived only if one avoids thinking about it; otherwise,\nfeelings of grief, fear, and despair would drive a man mad. Paul\neven looks upon those feelings with contempt, calling them “ornamental\nenough during peacetime” and implying that they are superfluous\nluxuries rather than essential components of the human experience.\nTo help the reader understand the pressure that is always upon the\nsoldier, Paul presents his appalling list of recent casualties,\nfriends, and comrades who were either killed or badly injured in\nrecent fighting. There is even a grotesque poetry to the list with\nthe alliteration and rhyme of the names Martens, Meyer, Max, and\nBeyer, demonstrating the stoic attitude that Paul claims is necessary\nfor survival."], "Comrade,\nI did not want to kill you. . . . But you were only an idea to me\nbefore, an abstraction that lived in my mind and called forth its\nappropriate response. . . . I thought of your hand-grenades, of\nyour bayonet, of your rifle; now I see your wife and your face and\nour fellowship. Forgive me, comrade. We always see it too late.\nWhy do they never tell us that you are poor devils like us, that\nyour mothers are just as anxious as ours, and that we have the same\nfear of death, and the same dying and the same agony—Forgive me, comrade;\nhow could you be my enemy? ": ["Paul utters these words in Chapter Nine\nto the corpse of Gérard Duval, the French soldier whom he has just\nkilled. Paul realizes for the first time that, despite the dictates\nof nationalism, Duval is fundamentally no different from him. As\nDuval becomes a fully realized person in Paul’s mind, as he thinks\nbeyond the man’s weapons to “your wife and your face and our fellowship,”\nPaul observes, as he does in Chapter Eight among the Russian prisoners,\nthat the war has forced men who are not enemies to fight each other.\nThe propaganda campaigns waged by the opposing governments have\nconvinced many men that their opponents are evil; as such, Paul\ninitially conceives of the French soldier as “an abstraction”—the\nenemy. Once he understands Duval as a human being, the artificial\ndivisions between the two men become irrelevant. Paul’s sympathy\nfor Duval’s suffering is evident in his address of him as “comrade”\nand his reference to himself and Duval as “we” and “us,” in opposition to\nthe “they”—those in power, who attempt to deny the essential sameness\nof men such as Paul and Duval."]}}, "further_study": {"context_link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/allquiet/context/", "study-questions_link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/allquiet/study-questions/", "study-questions": {"What are the main themes of All Quiet\non the Western Front?
