He buys a hundred square miles of land from an Indian tribe, raises a manor house, plants cotton, and marries the daughter of a local merchant, and within a few years is entrenched among the local aristocracy. Sutpen has a son and a daughter, Henry and Judith, who grow up in a life of uncultivated ease in the northern Mississippi countryside. Henry goes to college at the University of Mississippi in 1859, and meets a sophisticated fellow student named Charles Bon, whom he befriends and brings home for Christmas. Charles meets Judith, and over time, an engagement between them is assumed. But Sutpen realizes that Bon is actually his own son\u2014Henry and Judith's half-brother\u2014from a previous marriage which he abandoned when he discovered that his wife had negro blood. He tells Henry that the engagement cannot be, and that Bon is Henry's own brother; Henry reacts with outrage, refusing to believe that Bon knew all along and willingly became engaged to his own sister. Henry repudiates his birthright, and he and Bon flee to New Orleans. When war breaks out, they enlist, and spend four hard years fighting for the Confederacy as the South crumbles around them. At the end of the war, Sutpen (a colonel) finds his son and reveals to him that not only is Bon his and Judith's half-brother, he is also, in part, a black man.", "\n", "That knowledge makes Henry revolt against Bon in a way that even the idea of incest did not, and on the day Bon arrives to marry Judith, Henry murders him in front of the gates of the Sutpen plantation. Sutpen returns to a broken house, and becomes a broken\u2014though still forceful\u2014man; he slides slowly into alcoholism, begins an affair with a fifteen-year-old white girl named Milly, and continues in that vein until, following the birth of his and Milly's daughter, he is murdered by Milly's grandfather Wash Jones in 1869.", "\n", "Decades later, in 1909, Quentin Compson is a twenty-year-old man, the grandson of Sutpen's first friend in the country (General Compson), who is preparing to leave Jefferson to attend Harvard. He is summoned by Miss Rosa Coldfield, the sister of Sutpen's wife Ellen (and briefly Sutpen's fiancee herself), to hear the story of how Sutpen destroyed her family and his own. Over the following weeks and months, Quentin is drawn deeper and deeper into the Sutpen story, discussing it with his father, thinking about it, and later telling it in detail to his Harvard roommate Shreve. The story is burned into his brain the night he goes with Miss Rosa to the Sutpen plantation, where they find Henry Sutpen\u2014 now an old man\u2014waiting to die. Months later, Rosa attempts to return for Henry with an ambulance, but Clytie, Thomas Sutpen's daughter with a slave woman and now a withered old woman herself, sets fire to the manor house, killing herself and Henry, and bringing the Sutpen dynasty to a fiery end.", "\n"]}}

How doctors predicted he would die from complications of hydrocephalus\u2014his being born with excess spinal fluid on the brain. But, of course, Junior survived. The early condition, however, left Junior with a lisp and stutter. He had too many teeth and had to have some removed, and he is far-sighted in one eye and near-sighted in the other. Worst of all, as a small child he had seizures. Even today, other Indians on the reservation or, as Junior calls it, the \u201crez,\u201d bully him and call him names like \u201chydrohead.\u201d Junior\u2019s best friend, Rowdy, often promises to protect him, but Rowdy\u2019s own violent tendencies sometimes prevent him from being all that helpful. Junior\u2019s parents are alcoholics and his sister, Mary, spends all her time in the family basement. Junior loves drawing cartoons, and many of his drawings are included in the book. Rowdy is extremely supportive of Junior\u2019s art, and Junior thinks this proves his and Rowdy\u2019s friendship.", "\n", "In the summer before their freshman year of high school, Rowdy convinces Junior to go with him to the Spokane powwow. Junior is fourteen. Rowdy promises to protect Junior from any bullies, but, soon after they arrive, Rowdy trips into a van, embarrassing himself. Rowdy takes out his anger by attacking the van with a shovel, but the vandalism scares Junior. Junior runs away into a set of mean, drunk, thirty-year-old triplets. They push him around and beat him up. Later, to make up for having let Junior down, Rowdy sneaks into the triplets\u2019 camp at night and cuts off their long braids, emasculating them. Junior sees it as more proof that Rowdy does the best he can. Soon thereafter, Junior and Rowdy begin their first year at Wellpinit High. Junior is excited to get started and is especially looking forward to his geometry class. But his geometry teacher, Mr. P, gives Junior a textbook that Junior sees was signed by his mother, Agnes Adams, thirty years previously. He throws the textbook in a fit of rage. It hits Mr. P in the face, breaking his nose.", "\n", "After the textbook incident, Junior is suspended from school. Much to Junior\u2019s surprise, Mr. P comes to Junior\u2019s house to apologize to Junior. Mr. P tells Junior that there is no hope on the reservation, and that the best thing Junior can do for himself is to get off the reservation as quickly as possible. Mr. P says that Junior is smart, but that Mary was even smarter and more talented than Junior until the reservation crushed her spirit. Junior takes Mr. P advice, and, when his parents come home, he tells them he\u2019s decided to go to school in the all-white town of Reardan, some twenty-two miles from home. Junior\u2019s parents agree, and he starts school the next day. Because his family is very poor, sometimes without any money for gas, Junior often has difficulty getting to Reardan. He hitchhikes or gets rides from people like his dad\u2019s friend, Eugene. On his first day, Junior meets his future girlfriend, Penelope. A few days later, the toughest jock, Roger, insults Junior with a racist joke, and Junior punches him in the face. Junior is surprised to find that his action earns him Roger\u2019s respect. Then, Junior\u2019s future friend, Gordy, sticks up for Junior in class.", "\n", "On the reservation, however, Rowdy and the other Indians feel betrayed. Most react by ignoring Junior, but some are angrier than that. To impress Penelope, Junior decides to raise money for the homeless while trick-or-treating. But, after Junior starts going door-to-door, word gets around that he is carrying money. Junior gets jumped by three boys in masks. Junior fears that Rowdy is one of them. Penelope finds out and donates money in both her and Junior\u2019s names. Then, around Thanksgiving, Mary gets married to a Montana poker player she meets at the Spokane casino, and she moves with him to Montana without saying goodbye to her family. Junior wonders if Mary is competing with him because he managed to get off the reservation. Junior hears from Mary occasionally thereafter by email and letter. In her messages, Mary says she is struggling to find a job, but she remains optimistic.", "\n", "Later that fall, Junior tries out for the Reardan basketball team and has to play one-on-one against Roger, who is 6\u20196\u201d and can dunk. It\u2019s a tough match up, but Junior holds his own and is rewarded with a spot on the varsity team. Junior\u2019s team plays an early game against Wellpinit on the reservation where the entire crowd turns its back on Junior when his team enters the gym. While Junior is checking into the game for the first time, a fan throws a quarter at him, hitting him in the head. Junior asks Eugene, an EMT, to stich him up in the locker room, but, just after he checks back into the game, Rowdy fouls Junior so badly he gives Junior a concussion. Reardan loses badly, but, weeks later, in the teams\u2019 next match up at Reardan, Junior\u2019s strong defense leads Reardan to decisive victory. Wellpinit\u2019s season is ruined, and Reardan loses, later, early in the state playoffs.", "\n", "Then the tragedies begin.

The Party undermines family structure by inducting children\ninto an organization called the Junior Spies, which brainwashes\n and encourages them to spy on their parents and report any instance\nof disloyalty to the Party. The Party also forces individuals to\nsuppress their sexual desires, treating sex as merely a procreative\nduty whose end is the creation of new Party members. The Party then\nchannels people\u2019s pent-up frustration and emotion into intense,\nferocious displays of hatred against the Party\u2019s political enemies.\nMany of these enemies have been invented by the Party expressly\nfor this purpose."], "Physical Control": ["In addition to manipulating their minds, the Party also\ncontrols the bodies of its subjects. The Party constantly watches\nfor any sign of disloyalty, to the point that, as Winston observes,\neven a tiny facial twitch could lead to an arrest. A person\u2019s own\nnervous system becomes his greatest enemy. The Party forces its\nmembers to undergo mass morning exercises called the Physical Jerks,\nand then to work long, grueling days at government agencies, keeping\npeople in a general state of exhaustion. Anyone who does manage\nto defy the Party is punished and \u201creeducated\u201d through systematic\nand brutal torture. After being subjected to weeks of this intense\ntreatment, Winston himself comes to the conclusion that nothing\nis more powerful than physical pain\u2014no emotional loyalty or moral\nconviction can overcome it. By conditioning the minds of their victims\nwith physical torture, the Party is able to control reality, convincing\nits subjects that 2 + 2 = 5."], "Control of Information and History": ["The Party controls every source of information, managing\nand rewriting the content of all newspapers and histories for its\nown ends. The Party does not allow individuals to keep records of\ntheir past, such as photographs or documents. As a result, memories become\nfuzzy and unreliable, and citizens become perfectly willing to believe\nwhatever the Party tells them. By controlling the present, the Party\nis able to manipulate the past. And in controlling the past, the\nParty can justify all of its actions in the present."], "Technology": ["By means of telescreens and hidden microphones across\nthe city, the Party is able to monitor its members almost all of\nthe time. Additionally, the Party employs complicated mechanisms\n(", "1984", " was written\nin the era before computers) to exert large-scale control on economic\nproduction and sources of information, and fearsome machinery to\ninflict torture upon those it deems enemies. ", "1984", " reveals\nthat technology, which is generally perceived as working toward\nmoral good, can also facilitate the most diabolical evil."], "Individual Ambitions and Communal Obligations": ["Junior has great personal ambition. He wants to become a famous cartoonist and to make money. Becoming rich and famous, Junior reasons, will help him to escape the Spokane Indian Reservation. The problem is that, from Junior\u2019s perspective, what seems like better opportunity and freedom might, to the eyes of people in his larger community, look more like abandonment and betrayal. Once Junior decides to attend high school off the reservation at Reardan, he finds himself struggling both to discover his own personal identity and to relate back to the Spokane community. Junior has struggled, and often failed, to find acceptance there his entire life. He feels a responsibility to prove himself to Rowdy and the other Indians that see him as a traitor. At the same time, Junior tries to make a new name for himself at the all-white Reardan High School. At Reardan, Junior gains fresh perspective on the things that are bad about life on the reservation\u2014alcoholism, hopelessness, and a lack of tolerance. But, with the help of friends and family, Junior is also able to relate his personal ambitions back to his Indian heritage.", "By wandering farther from home, Junior better understands his roots. Thanks to his dad and his dad\u2019s friend, Eugene, Junior is able to see leaving the reservation and going to an all-white school as courageous. He isn\u2019t a coward, but a warrior. Likewise, Rowdy helps Junior to see how his going to school off the reservation can be linked back to the nomadism\u2014the wandering from place to place\u2014that was a part of his tribe\u2019s culture for centuries. It is the people wasting their lives getting drunk on the reservation, Rowdy suggests, that have forgotten their community.  As time goes on, Junior also finds belonging in other groups, like the Reardan basketball team, and he realizes that he is part of many less apparent communities, other \u201ctribes,\u201d like the tribe of poor people and the tribe of tortilla chip and salsa lovers. Junior takes comfort in the fact that he belongs to these groups. They strengthen his identity. At the same time, he hopes that, by asserting himself in the right ways, he can bring good things back to the communities that support him."], "Poverty and Privilege": ["One of the main differences between life on the reservation and life in Reardan is that most of the families on the reservation, including Junior\u2019s, are poor. This means that Junior often misses meals and school because his parents have no money for food or gas. Embarrassed by his poverty, Junior does everything he can to keep his Reardan classmates from understanding the true state of affairs. He often invents excuses or lies to his friends by saying he accidentally left his wallet at home. The white students at Reardan are financially better off, but Junior is surprised to learn that the privilege that accompanies wealth and white skin doesn\u2019t insulate his friends from pain and problems. Penelope, despite her popularity and beauty, is bulimic, and Gordy, despite his shining intellect, is emotionally isolated and has difficulty relating to others. These problems of privilege are no less real than the problems of poverty, but the main difference\u2014the thing that makes poverty so challenging\u2014is that poverty prohibits people from pursuing hope and opportunity. And, what\u2019s more, poor people often find themselves without the privilege to sort through or find help for their own equally real emotional struggles."], "Racism": ["Junior always uses the term \u201cIndian\u201d to describe himself and the others on the Spokane Reservation. He never explains why he favors this term over the arguably more politically correct \u201cNative American.\u201d One can argue that \u201cIndian\u201d is more direct, less sugarcoated. Reardan\u2019s white football star, Roger, certainly does not celebrate Junior\u2019s heritage when he tells Junior that, \u201cIndians are living proof that niggers fuck buffalo.\u201d  Using the term Indian, then, is also a concession to the racism in Junior\u2019s social environment. The net effect of the racism and bigotry levied against Junior and his tribe on personal, institutional, and national levels is a collective disempowerment that stands in stark contrast to the unconscious privilege and opportunity in the neighboring white communities. But, Junior comes to realize, he participates in these same structures of prejudice. Junior sometimes uses homophobic language, for example, as a way to relate to and communicate with people like Rowdy for whom such language is the norm. Junior\u2019s friends, likewise, show him that he pays so much attention to Penelope in part because she is white. Junior\u2019s realization that he, too, has some racial biases is a key part of his moral education."]}}}
