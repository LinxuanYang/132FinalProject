      "Plot Overview",
      "\n",
      "Arnold Spirit Jr. (\u201cJunior\u201d) tells about his early life on the Spokane Indian reservation. How doctors predicted he would die from complications of hydrocephalus\u2014his being born with excess spinal fluid on the brain. But, of course, Junior survived. The early condition, however, left Junior with a lisp and stutter. He had too many teeth and had to have some removed, and he is far-sighted in one eye and near-sighted in the other. Worst of all, as a small child he had seizures. Even today, other Indians on the reservation or, as Junior calls it, the \u201crez,\u201d bully him and call him names like \u201chydrohead.\u201d Junior\u2019s best friend, Rowdy, often promises to protect him, but Rowdy\u2019s own violent tendencies sometimes prevent him from being all that helpful. Junior\u2019s parents are alcoholics and his sister, Mary, spends all her time in the family basement. Junior loves drawing cartoons, and many of his drawings are included in the book. Rowdy is extremely supportive of Junior\u2019s art, and Junior thinks this proves his and Rowdy\u2019s friendship.",
      "\n",
      "In the summer before their freshman year of high school, Rowdy convinces Junior to go with him to the Spokane powwow. Junior is fourteen. Rowdy promises to protect Junior from any bullies, but, soon after they arrive, Rowdy trips into a van, embarrassing himself. Rowdy takes out his anger by attacking the van with a shovel, but the vandalism scares Junior. Junior runs away into a set of mean, drunk, thirty-year-old triplets. They push him around and beat him up. Later, to make up for having let Junior down, Rowdy sneaks into the triplets\u2019 camp at night and cuts off their long braids, emasculating them. Junior sees it as more proof that Rowdy does the best he can. Soon thereafter, Junior and Rowdy begin their first year at Wellpinit High. Junior is excited to get started and is especially looking forward to his geometry class. But his geometry teacher, Mr. P, gives Junior a textbook that Junior sees was signed by his mother, Agnes Adams, thirty years previously. He throws the textbook in a fit of rage. It hits Mr. P in the face, breaking his nose.",
      "\n",
      "After the textbook incident, Junior is suspended from school. Much to Junior\u2019s surprise, Mr. P comes to Junior\u2019s house to apologize to Junior. Mr. P tells Junior that there is no hope on the reservation, and that the best thing Junior can do for himself is to get off the reservation as quickly as possible. Mr. P says that Junior is smart, but that Mary was even smarter and more talented than Junior until the reservation crushed her spirit. Junior takes Mr. P advice, and, when his parents come home, he tells them he\u2019s decided to go to school in the all-white town of Reardan, some twenty-two miles from home. Junior\u2019s parents agree, and he starts school the next day. Because his family is very poor, sometimes without any money for gas, Junior often has difficulty getting to Reardan. He hitchhikes or gets rides from people like his dad\u2019s friend, Eugene. On his first day, Junior meets his future girlfriend, Penelope. A few days later, the toughest jock, Roger, insults Junior with a racist joke, and Junior punches him in the face. Junior is surprised to find that his action earns him Roger\u2019s respect. Then, Junior\u2019s future friend, Gordy, sticks up for Junior in class.",
      "\n",
      "On the reservation, however, Rowdy and the other Indians feel betrayed. Most react by ignoring Junior, but some are angrier than that. To impress Penelope, Junior decides to raise money for the homeless while trick-or-treating. But, after Junior starts going door-to-door, word gets around that he is carrying money. Junior gets jumped by three boys in masks. Junior fears that Rowdy is one of them. Penelope finds out and donates money in both her and Junior\u2019s names. Then, around Thanksgiving, Mary gets married to a Montana poker player she meets at the Spokane casino, and she moves with him to Montana without saying goodbye to her family. Junior wonders if Mary is competing with him because he managed to get off the reservation. Junior hears from Mary occasionally thereafter by email and letter. In her messages, Mary says she is struggling to find a job, but she remains optimistic.",
      "\n",
      "Later that fall, Junior tries out for the Reardan basketball team and has to play one-on-one against Roger, who is 6\u20196\u201d and can dunk. It\u2019s a tough match up, but Junior holds his own and is rewarded with a spot on the varsity team. Junior\u2019s team plays an early game against Wellpinit on the reservation where the entire crowd turns its back on Junior when his team enters the gym. While Junior is checking into the game for the first time, a fan throws a quarter at him, hitting him in the head. Junior asks Eugene, an EMT, to stich him up in the locker room, but, just after he checks back into the game, Rowdy fouls Junior so badly he gives Junior a concussion. Reardan loses badly, but, weeks later, in the teams\u2019 next match up at Reardan, Junior\u2019s strong defense leads Reardan to decisive victory. Wellpinit\u2019s season is ruined, and Reardan loses, later, early in the state playoffs.",
      "\n",
      "Then the tragedies begin. Junior\u2019s grandmother, whom Junior admires for her tolerance and generosity, is struck and killed by a drunk driver as she is walking home from a powwow. A white billionaire named Ted makes a pompous speech at her well-attended funeral, and the Indians laugh him off the reservation. Then, Eugene\u2019s friend, Bobby, shoots Eugene in the face over the last sip of a bottle of wine. Later, just when Junior thinks things can\u2019t get any worse, the school guidance counselor calls him into the hall to tell him that Mary has died. Junior\u2019s dad picks him up from school and tells him that Mary and her husband\u2019s trailer caught on fire while the two were passed out from excess drinking. Rowdy blames Junior for Mary\u2019s death, but Junior somehow manages to finish the school year and get a decent report card. He and his family begin to heal, and he promises his Mom that he will never drink. That summer, Rowdy comes to Junior\u2019s house to see if Junior will hang out. The book ends with the two playing a game of one-on-one in the summer heat.",

      "Individual Ambitions and Communal Obligations": [
        "Junior has great personal ambition. He wants to become a famous cartoonist and to make money. Becoming rich and famous, Junior reasons, will help him to escape the Spokane Indian Reservation. The problem is that, from Junior\u2019s perspective, what seems like better opportunity and freedom might, to the eyes of people in his larger community, look more like abandonment and betrayal. Once Junior decides to attend high school off the reservation at Reardan, he finds himself struggling both to discover his own personal identity and to relate back to the Spokane community. Junior has struggled, and often failed, to find acceptance there his entire life. He feels a responsibility to prove himself to Rowdy and the other Indians that see him as a traitor. At the same time, Junior tries to make a new name for himself at the all-white Reardan High School. At Reardan, Junior gains fresh perspective on the things that are bad about life on the reservation\u2014alcoholism, hopelessness, and a lack of tolerance. But, with the help of friends and family, Junior is also able to relate his personal ambitions back to his Indian heritage.",
        "By wandering farther from home, Junior better understands his roots. Thanks to his dad and his dad\u2019s friend, Eugene, Junior is able to see leaving the reservation and going to an all-white school as courageous. He isn\u2019t a coward, but a warrior. Likewise, Rowdy helps Junior to see how his going to school off the reservation can be linked back to the nomadism\u2014the wandering from place to place\u2014that was a part of his tribe\u2019s culture for centuries. It is the people wasting their lives getting drunk on the reservation, Rowdy suggests, that have forgotten their community.  As time goes on, Junior also finds belonging in other groups, like the Reardan basketball team, and he realizes that he is part of many less apparent communities, other \u201ctribes,\u201d like the tribe of poor people and the tribe of tortilla chip and salsa lovers. Junior takes comfort in the fact that he belongs to these groups. They strengthen his identity. At the same time, he hopes that, by asserting himself in the right ways, he can bring good things back to the communities that support him."
      ],
      "Poverty and Privilege": [
        "One of the main differences between life on the reservation and life in Reardan is that most of the families on the reservation, including Junior\u2019s, are poor. This means that Junior often misses meals and school because his parents have no money for food or gas. Embarrassed by his poverty, Junior does everything he can to keep his Reardan classmates from understanding the true state of affairs. He often invents excuses or lies to his friends by saying he accidentally left his wallet at home. The white students at Reardan are financially better off, but Junior is surprised to learn that the privilege that accompanies wealth and white skin doesn\u2019t insulate his friends from pain and problems. Penelope, despite her popularity and beauty, is bulimic, and Gordy, despite his shining intellect, is emotionally isolated and has difficulty relating to others. These problems of privilege are no less real than the problems of poverty, but the main difference\u2014the thing that makes poverty so challenging\u2014is that poverty prohibits people from pursuing hope and opportunity. And, what\u2019s more, poor people often find themselves without the privilege to sort through or find help for their own equally real emotional struggles."
      ],
      "Racism": [
        "Junior always uses the term \u201cIndian\u201d to describe himself and the others on the Spokane Reservation. He never explains why he favors this term over the arguably more politically correct \u201cNative American.\u201d One can argue that \u201cIndian\u201d is more direct, less sugarcoated. Reardan\u2019s white football star, Roger, certainly does not celebrate Junior\u2019s heritage when he tells Junior that, \u201cIndians are living proof that niggers fuck buffalo.\u201d  Using the term Indian, then, is also a concession to the racism in Junior\u2019s social environment. The net effect of the racism and bigotry levied against Junior and his tribe on personal, institutional, and national levels is a collective disempowerment that stands in stark contrast to the unconscious privilege and opportunity in the neighboring white communities. But, Junior comes to realize, he participates in these same structures of prejudice. Junior sometimes uses homophobic language, for example, as a way to relate to and communicate with people like Rowdy for whom such language is the norm. Junior\u2019s friends, likewise, show him that he pays so much attention to Penelope in part because she is white. Junior\u2019s realization that he, too, has some racial biases is a key part of his moral education."

The cartoons that pepper the text of The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian are actually by the artist Ellen Forney, so the book is a collaborative project between Alexie, who authored the text, and Forney, who drew the cartoons. Alexie began the book as a memoir, but ultimately decided that an autobiographical novel was more fitting for his material. Some would argue that Junior\u2019s relationship to cartoons, which is one of the few media that Alexie has not pursued in his professional life, is a stand-in for Alexie\u2019s adolescent relationship toward writing stories and poems. The passage shows how Junior would like to use his art as a springboard to a better life. But drawing is not just a way for Junior to cope with and escape the challenges he faces on the reservation. Drawing, as Junior explains elsewhere gives Junior a means to honor his friends and family. Junior\u2019s drawing, therefore, is not just a selfish or self-involved pursuit. Drawing gives Junior his particular way of contributing to his community.",

The ability to overcome adversity by escaping it is, in fact, one of the key indicators of a privileged life. Junior suggests that only privileged people\u2014namely, people who have never been poor\u2014can hold such romanticized ideas about what it means to go hungry or not to be able to help one\u2019s friends. For the truly poor, there is no escape from poverty, and the only way to overcome adversity, is to get better at tolerating it. The quotation sets the matter-of-fact, no-nonsense tone Junior will use to treat much of the political material that crops up in The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian.

Gordy explains to Junior that to appreciate the whole of a great work of art, you have to appreciate its parts. When it comes to books, that means looking up individual words and researching their history. This makes immediate sense to Junior, for whom reading and learning have been a central component of life, but it also shows just how much of Junior\u2019s energy has been directed toward escaping unpleasant life experiences\u2014such as being bullied or going hungry\u2014by reading books and making art. On the one hand, this is Junior questioning whether he has placed more significance on how he reads than on how he lives. But, on the other hand, Junior arrives at this renewed appreciation for every moment, no matter how difficult, because his literary education led him there.

        "Junior offers these lines near the end of the novel in the chapter titled, \u201cBecause Russian Guys Are Not Always Geniuses.\u201d He is reflecting on the prevalence of death on the reservation, its ties to alcoholism, and how death, too, is one of the factors that differentiate life on the reservation from life in the wider, white world. The quote not only illustrates this stark contrast in early life for young American Indians compared to white teenagers, it also shows off Junior\u2019s unique sense of humor. Humor is one of the ways Junior copes with the death he has faced, and the joke, here, of counting up ones penis, butt cheeks and nipples to arrive at the tally of deaths one has experienced in life also contains a starker reckoning. When Junior divides his body into all of its components like this, it ultimately emphasizes the mortality Junior is speaking about. In the passage, Junior\u2019s own body becomes a memento mori\u2014a reminder for him that one-day he too will die.",

      "Winston Smith is a low-ranking\nmember of the ruling Party in London, in the nation\nof Oceania. Everywhere Winston goes, even his own home, the Party\nwatches him through telescreens; everywhere he looks he sees the\nface of the Party\u2019s seemingly omniscient leader, a figure known\nonly as Big Brother. The Party controls everything in Oceania, even\nthe people\u2019s history and language. Currently, the Party is forcing\nthe implementation of an invented language called Newspeak, which\nattempts to prevent political rebellion by eliminating all words\nrelated to it. Even thinking rebellious thoughts is illegal. Such\nthoughtcrime is, in fact, the worst of all crimes.",

Winston dislikes the party and has illegally\npurchased a diary in which to write his criminal thoughts. He has\nalso become fixated on a powerful Party member named O\u2019Brien, whom\nWinston believes is a secret member of the Brotherhood\u2014the mysterious,\nlegendary group that works to overthrow the Party.",

He notices a coworker,\na beautiful dark-haired girl, staring at him, and worries that she\nis an informant who will turn him in for his thoughtcrime. He is\ntroubled by the Party\u2019s control of history: the Party claims that\nOceania has always been allied with Eastasia in a war against Eurasia,\nbut Winston seems to recall a time when this was not true. The Party\nalso claims that Emmanuel Goldstein, the alleged leader of the Brotherhood,\nis the most dangerous man alive, but this does not seem plausible\nto Winston. Winston spends his evenings wandering through the poorest\nneighborhoods in London, where the proletarians, or proles, live\nsqualid lives, relatively free of Party monitoring.",

      "One day, Winston receives a note from the dark-haired\ngirl that reads \u201cI love you.\u201d She tells him her name, Julia, and\nthey begin a covert affair, always on the lookout for signs of Party\nmonitoring. Eventually they rent a room above the secondhand store\nin the prole district where Winston bought the diary. This relationship\nlasts for some time. Winston is sure that they will be caught and\npunished sooner or later (the fatalistic Winston knows that he has\nbeen doomed since he wrote his first diary entry), while Julia is\nmore pragmatic and optimistic. As Winston\u2019s affair with Julia progresses, his\nhatred for the Party grows more and more intense. At last, he receives\nthe message that he has been waiting for: O\u2019Brien wants to see him.",

O\u2019Brien confirms to Winston and Julia that, like them,\nhe hates the Party, and says that he works against it as a member\nof the Brotherhood. He indoctrinates Winston and Julia into the\nBrotherhood, and gives Winston a copy of Emmanuel Goldstein\u2019s book,\nthe manifesto of the Brotherhood. Winston reads the book\u2014an amalgam\nof several forms of class-based twentieth-century social theory\u2014to Julia\nin the room above the store. Suddenly, soldiers barge in and seize\nthem.

O\u2019Brien spends\nmonths torturing and brainwashing Winston, who struggles to resist.\nAt last, O\u2019Brien sends him to the dreaded Room 101,\nthe final destination for anyone who opposes the Party. Here, O\u2019Brien\ntells Winston that he will be forced to confront his worst fear.\nThroughout the novel, Winston has had recurring nightmares about\nrats; O\u2019Brien now straps a cage full of rats onto Winston\u2019s head\nand prepares to allow the rats to eat his face. Winston snaps, pleading\nwith O\u2019Brien to do it to Julia, not to him.",

      "The Dangers of Totalitarianism": [
        "\n",
        "1984",
        " is\na political novel written with the purpose of warning readers in\nthe West of the dangers of totalitarian government. Having witnessed\nfirsthand the horrific lengths to which totalitarian governments\nin Spain and Russia would go in order to sustain and increase their\npower, Orwell designed ",
        "1984",
        " to\nsound the alarm in Western nations still unsure about how to approach\nthe rise of communism. In 1949, the Cold\nWar had not yet escalated, many American intellectuals supported\ncommunism, and the state of diplomacy between democratic and communist\nnations was highly ambiguous. In the American press, the Soviet\nUnion was often portrayed as a great moral experiment. Orwell, however,\nwas deeply disturbed by the widespread cruelties and oppressions\nhe observed in communist countries, and seems to have been particularly\nconcerned by the role of technology in enabling oppressive governments\nto monitor and control their citizens.",
        "In ",
        "1984, ",
        "Orwell\nportrays the perfect totalitarian society, the most extreme realization\nimaginable of a modern-day government with absolute power. The title\nof the novel was meant to indicate to its readers in 1949 that\nthe story represented a real possibility for the near future: if\ntotalitarianism were not opposed, the title suggested, some variation\nof the world described in the novel could become a reality in only\nthirty-five years. Orwell portrays a state in which government monitors\nand controls every aspect of human life to the extent that even\nhaving a disloyal thought is against the law. As the novel progresses,\nthe timidly rebellious Winston Smith sets out to challenge the limits\nof the Party\u2019s power, only to discover that its ability to control\nand enslave its subjects dwarfs even his most paranoid conceptions\nof its reach. As the reader comes to understand through Winston\u2019s\neyes, The Party uses a number of techniques to control its citizens,\neach of which is an important theme of its own in the novel. These\ninclude:"
      ],
      "Psychological Manipulation": [
        "The Party barrages its subjects with psychological stimuli\ndesigned to overwhelm the mind\u2019s capacity for independent thought.\nThe giant telescreen in every citizen\u2019s room blasts a constant stream\nof propaganda designed to make the failures and shortcomings of\nthe Party appear to be triumphant successes. The telescreens also\nmonitor behavior\u2014everywhere they go, citizens are continuously reminded,\nespecially by means of the omnipresent signs reading ",
        "\u201cBIG\nBROTHER IS WATCHING YOU,\u201d",
        " that the authorities are scrutinizing\nthem. The Party undermines family structure by inducting children\ninto an organization called the Junior Spies, which brainwashes\n and encourages them to spy on their parents and report any instance\nof disloyalty to the Party. The Party also forces individuals to\nsuppress their sexual desires, treating sex as merely a procreative\nduty whose end is the creation of new Party members. The Party then\nchannels people\u2019s pent-up frustration and emotion into intense,\nferocious displays of hatred against the Party\u2019s political enemies.\nMany of these enemies have been invented by the Party expressly\nfor this purpose."
      ],
      "Physical Control": [
        "In addition to manipulating their minds, the Party also\ncontrols the bodies of its subjects. The Party constantly watches\nfor any sign of disloyalty, to the point that, as Winston observes,\neven a tiny facial twitch could lead to an arrest. A person\u2019s own\nnervous system becomes his greatest enemy. The Party forces its\nmembers to undergo mass morning exercises called the Physical Jerks,\nand then to work long, grueling days at government agencies, keeping\npeople in a general state of exhaustion. Anyone who does manage\nto defy the Party is punished and \u201creeducated\u201d through systematic\nand brutal torture. After being subjected to weeks of this intense\ntreatment, Winston himself comes to the conclusion that nothing\nis more powerful than physical pain\u2014no emotional loyalty or moral\nconviction can overcome it. By conditioning the minds of their victims\nwith physical torture, the Party is able to control reality, convincing\nits subjects that 2 + 2 = 5."
      ],
      "Control of Information and History": [
        "The Party controls every source of information, managing\nand rewriting the content of all newspapers and histories for its\nown ends. The Party does not allow individuals to keep records of\ntheir past, such as photographs or documents. As a result, memories become\nfuzzy and unreliable, and citizens become perfectly willing to believe\nwhatever the Party tells them. By controlling the present, the Party\nis able to manipulate the past. And in controlling the past, the\nParty can justify all of its actions in the present."
      ],
      "Technology": [
        "By means of telescreens and hidden microphones across\nthe city, the Party is able to monitor its members almost all of\nthe time. Additionally, the Party employs complicated mechanisms\n(",
        "1984",
        " was written\nin the era before computers) to exert large-scale control on economic\nproduction and sources of information, and fearsome machinery to\ninflict torture upon those it deems enemies. ",
        "1984",
        " reveals\nthat technology, which is generally perceived as working toward\nmoral good, can also facilitate the most diabolical evil."
      ],
      "Language as Mind Control": [
        "One of Orwell\u2019s most important messages in ",
        "1984",
        " is\nthat language is of central importance to human thought because\nit structures and limits the ideas that individuals are capable\nof formulating and expressing. If control of language were centralized\nin a political agency, Orwell proposes, such an agency could possibly\nalter the very structure of language to make it impossible to even\nconceive of disobedient or rebellious thoughts, because there would\nbe no words with which to think them. This idea manifests itself\nin the language of Newspeak, which the Party has introduced to replace English.\nThe Party is constantly refining and perfecting Newspeak, with the\nultimate goal that no one will be capable of conceptualizing anything\nthat might question the Party\u2019s absolute power.",
        "Interestingly, many of Orwell\u2019s ideas about language as\na controlling force have been modified by writers and critics seeking\nto deal with the legacy of colonialism. During colonial times, foreign powers\ntook political and military control of distant regions and, as a\npart of their occupation, instituted their own language as the language\nof government and business. Postcolonial writers often analyze or\nredress the damage done to local populations by the loss of language\nand the attendant loss of culture and historical connection."
      ],
      "Loyalty": [
        "In ",
        "1984",
        ", the Party seeks to ensure that the only kind of loyalty possible is loyalty to the Party. The reader sees examples of virtually every kind of loyalty, from the most fundamental to the most trivial, being destroyed by the Party. Neighbors and coworkers inform on one another, and Mr. Parson\u2019s own child reports him to the Thought Police. Winston\u2019s half-remembered marriage to his wife fell apart with no sense of loyalty. Even the relationship between customer and merchant is perverted as Winston learns that the man who has sold him the very tools of his resistance and independence was a member of the Thought Police. Winston\u2019s relationship with Julia is the ultimate loyalty that is tested by the events of the book. In Book Two: Chapter VII, Winston tells Julia, \u201cif they could make me stop loving you\u2014that would be the real betrayal.\u201d In the end, the Party does make Winston stop loving Julia and love Big Brother instead, the only form of loyalty allowed."
      ],
      "Resistance and Revolution": [
        "In ",
        "1984, ",
        "Winston explores increasingly risky and significant acts of resistance against the Party. In Book One: Chapter VII, Winston observes that \u201crebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflection of the voice; at the most, an occasional whispered word.\u201d Winston builds up these minor rebellions by committing personal acts of disobedience such as keeping a journal and buying a decorative paperweight. Eventually he escalates his rebellion through his sexual relationship with Julia. The relationship is a double rebellion, as it includes the thoughtcrime of desire. Winston doesn\u2019t believe his actions or the actions of others will lead to the destruction of the Party within his lifetime, but before he is caught by the Thought Police he holds out hope that in the future someone will be able to look back at Winston\u2019s time from a world that is free.",
        "Winston\u2019s most concrete hope for actual revolution against the Party lies with the social underclass of the city, called the proles. He observes that the proles already have far greater numbers than the Party and that the proles have the strength to carry out a revolution if they could ever organize themselves. The problem is that the proles have been subject to such serious poverty for so long that they are unable to see past the goal of survival. The very notion of trying to build a better world is too much for them to contemplate. All of these observations are set against the backdrop of the Party\u2019s own identity as the product of revolution. According to Winston, the Party was created during the mid-1960s during a revolution that overthrew the existing British social order. The Party claims that the Revolution has not yet ended and that it will be fulfilled once they have complete control."
      ],
      "Independence and Identity": [
        "While the Party\u2019s primary tool for manipulating the populace is the control of history, they also control independence and identity. For example, the basic traits of establishing one\u2019s identity are unavailable to Winston and the other citizens of Oceania. Winston does not know how old he is. He does not know whether he is married or not. He does not know whether his mother is alive or dead. None of his childhood memories are reliable, because he has no photos or documents to help him sort real memories from imagined ones. Instead of being unique individuals with specific, identifying details, every member of the Outer Party is identical. All Party members wear the same clothing, smoke the same brand of cigarettes, drink the same brand of gin, and so forth. As such, forming a sense of individual identity is not only psychologically challenging, but logistically difficult."

      "In 1833, a wild, imposing man named Thomas Sutpen comes to Jefferson, Mississippi, with a group of slaves and a French architect in tow. He buys a hundred square miles of land from an Indian tribe, raises a manor house, plants cotton, and marries the daughter of a local merchant, and within a few years is entrenched among the local aristocracy. Sutpen has a son and a daughter, Henry and Judith, who grow up in a life of uncultivated ease in the northern Mississippi countryside. Henry goes to college at the University of Mississippi in 1859, and meets a sophisticated fellow student named Charles Bon, whom he befriends and brings home for Christmas. Charles meets Judith, and over time, an engagement between them is assumed. But Sutpen realizes that Bon is actually his own son\u2014Henry and Judith's half-brother\u2014from a previous marriage which he abandoned when he discovered that his wife had negro blood. He tells Henry that the engagement cannot be, and that Bon is Henry's own brother; Henry reacts with outrage, refusing to believe that Bon knew all along and willingly became engaged to his own sister. Henry repudiates his birthright, and he and Bon flee to New Orleans. When war breaks out, they enlist, and spend four hard years fighting for the Confederacy as the South crumbles around them. At the end of the war, Sutpen (a colonel) finds his son and reveals to him that not only is Bon his and Judith's half-brother, he is also, in part, a black man.",
      "\n",
      "That knowledge makes Henry revolt against Bon in a way that even the idea of incest did not, and on the day Bon arrives to marry Judith, Henry murders him in front of the gates of the Sutpen plantation. Sutpen returns to a broken house, and becomes a broken\u2014though still forceful\u2014man; he slides slowly into alcoholism, begins an affair with a fifteen-year-old white girl named Milly, and continues in that vein until, following the birth of his and Milly's daughter, he is murdered by Milly's grandfather Wash Jones in 1869.",
      "\n",
      "Decades later, in 1909, Quentin Compson is a twenty-year-old man, the grandson of Sutpen's first friend in the country (General Compson), who is preparing to leave Jefferson to attend Harvard. He is summoned by Miss Rosa Coldfield, the sister of Sutpen's wife Ellen (and briefly Sutpen's fiancee herself), to hear the story of how Sutpen destroyed her family and his own. Over the following weeks and months, Quentin is drawn deeper and deeper into the Sutpen story, discussing it with his father, thinking about it, and later telling it in detail to his Harvard roommate Shreve. The story is burned into his brain the night he goes with Miss Rosa to the Sutpen plantation, where they find Henry Sutpen\u2014 now an old man\u2014waiting to die. Months later, Rosa attempts to return for Henry with an ambulance, but Clytie, Thomas Sutpen's daughter with a slave woman and now a withered old woman herself, sets fire to the manor house, killing herself and Henry, and bringing the Sutpen dynasty to a fiery end.",
