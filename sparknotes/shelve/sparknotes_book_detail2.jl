Alice realizes that she is not just trying to figure\nout Wonderland, but also attempting to determine who she is and\nwhat constitutes her identity in a world that actively challenges\nher perspective and sense of self. Wonderland has already begun\nto affect Alice, and she rightly understands that her self perception\ncannot remain fixed in a world that has drastically different rules\nfrom her own. In Wonderland, Alice has a slippery grasp of her identity.\nSince Wonderland is a byproduct of her own imagination, it becomes\nclear that it is Alice’s identity and not Wonderland itself that\nis being called into question. The nonsensical features and characters\nthat make up Wonderland extend from Alice’s own psyche, so her quest\nto understand Wonderland becomes a quest to understand the forces\nand feelings that comprise her identity. The idea of the great puzzle\nalso supports Carroll’s notion that life is an unduly complicated\nmystery that human beings must use rational thought and intelligence\nto understand."], "2.\tLastly, she pictured to herself\nhow this same little sister of hers would, in the after‑time, be\nherself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper\nyears, the simple and loving heart of her childhood; and how she would\ngather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright\nand eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream\nof Wonderland of long ago; and how she would feel with all their\nsimple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering\nher own child‑life, and the happy summer days.

This passage has a tone of long winded,\ngolden nostalgia and differs dramatically from the rest of the story,\nwhich is generally economical in words and nightmarish for Alice.\nThis tonal shift results from the shift in perspective from Alice\nto her sister, which in turn alters the reader’s perception of Alice’s\nadventures. While she experiences her adventures, Alice finds her\njourney to be confounding and nightmarish. On the other hand, Alice’s\nsister sees her story as a strange tale from a simple heart. She\ntrivializes Alice’s identity shattering journey, distancing the\ntrauma Alice experienced in her dream with her own aboveground faith\nin an orderly universe. In a story studded with subversion, Alice’s\nsister becomes the ultimate subversion who undermines Alice’s search\nfor meaning and identity as she imagines Alice growing up and mystifying\nother simple‑hearted children with her stories.", "This quote also serves as Carroll’s commentary on the\ncharacter of Alice, the fictionalized version of his muse Alice\nLiddell. Carroll became deeply preoccupied with the dissolution\nof his friendship with Liddell as she reached maturity and grew\napart from him. This final line has a nostalgic, wistful longing\nfor “the happy summer days” in which he would visit with the Liddell\nsisters and delight them “with many a strange tale.” Ultimately,\nCarroll realizes that these happy summer days cannot last, and like\nAlice’s dream or even Alice’s sister’s dream, the simple hearted\nlove of a child will fade, leaving him only with memories of “child‑life.”"]}}}

Frank is unwilling\nto appear needy or to appeal to other people’s charitable instincts\nto satisfy his hunger. In fact, he would rather steal than beg to\nsurvive.

Creon threatens to kill anyone who tries to bury Polynices\nand stations sentries over his body.

Soon, a nervous sentry arrives at the\npalace to tell Creon that, while the sentries slept, someone gave Polynices\nburial rites.

Haemon, Creon’s son and Antigone’s betrothed, enters the\nstage. Creon asks him his opinion on the issue.

But his change of heart comes too late.

They went in and saw Antigone\nhanging from a noose, and Haemon raving. Creon’s son then took a\nsword and thrust it at his father.

Oedipus questions Creon about the murder of Laius, who\nwas killed by thieves on his way to consult an oracle. Only one\nof his fellow travelers escaped alive.

Tiresias responds cryptically,\nlamenting his ability to see the truth when the truth brings nothing\nbut pain. At first he refuses to tell Oedipus what he knows. Oedipus\ncurses and insults the old man, going so far as to accuse him of\nthe murder. These taunts provoke Tiresias into revealing that Oedipus\nhimself is the murderer. Oedipus naturally refuses to believe Tiresias’s\naccusation. He accuses Creon and Tiresias of conspiring against\nhis life, and charges Tiresias with insanity. He asks why Tiresias\ndid nothing when Thebes suffered under a plague once before. At\nthat time, a Sphinx held the city captive and refused to leave until\nsomeone answered her riddle. Oedipus brags that he alone was able\nto solve the puzzle. Tiresias defends his skills as a prophet, noting\nthat Oedipus’s parents found him trustworthy. At this mention of\nhis parents, Oedipus, who grew up in the distant city of Corinth,\nasks how Tiresias knew his parents. But Tiresias answers enigmatically.\nThen, before leaving the stage, Tiresias puts forth one last riddle,\nsaying that the murderer of Laius will turn out to be both father\nand brother to his own children, and the son of his own wife.", "\n", "After Tiresias leaves, Oedipus threatens Creon with death\nor exile for conspiring with the prophet. Oedipus’s wife, Jocasta\n(also the widow of King Laius), enters and asks why the men shout\nat one another. Oedipus explains to Jocasta that the prophet has\ncharged him with Laius’s murder, and Jocasta replies that all prophecies\nare false. As proof, she notes that the Delphic oracle once told\nLaius he would be murdered by his son, when in fact his son was\ncast out of Thebes as a baby, and Laius was murdered by a band of\nthieves. Her description of Laius’s murder, however, sounds familiar\nto Oedipus, and he asks further questions. Jocasta tells him that\nLaius was killed at a three-way crossroads, just before Oedipus\narrived in Thebes. Oedipus, stunned, tells his wife that he may\nbe the one who murdered Laius. He tells Jocasta that, long ago,\nwhen he was the prince of Corinth, he overheard someone mention\nat a banquet that he was not really the son of the king and queen.\nHe therefore traveled to the oracle of Delphi, who did not answer\nhim but did tell him he would murder his father and sleep with his\nmother. Hearing this, Oedipus fled his home, never to return. It\nwas then, on the journey that would take him to Thebes, that Oedipus\nwas confronted and harassed by a group of travelers, whom he killed\nin self-defense. This skirmish occurred at the very crossroads where\nLaius was killed.", "\n", "Oedipus sends for the man who survived the attack, a shepherd, in\nthe hope that he will not be identified as the murderer. Outside\nthe palace, a messenger approaches Jocasta and tells her that he\nhas come from Corinth to inform Oedipus that his father, Polybus,\nis dead, and that Corinth has asked Oedipus to come and rule there\nin his place. Jocasta rejoices, convinced that Polybus’s death from\nnatural causes has disproved the prophecy that Oedipus would murder his\nfather. At Jocasta’s summons, Oedipus comes outside, hears the news,\nand rejoices with her. He now feels much more inclined to agree\nwith the queen in deeming prophecies worthless and viewing chance\nas the principle governing the world. But while Oedipus finds great\ncomfort in the fact that one-half of the prophecy has been disproved,\nhe still fears the other half—the half that claimed he would sleep\nwith his mother.", "\n", "The messenger remarks that Oedipus need not worry, because Polybus\nand his wife, Merope, are not Oedipus’s biological parents.

She runs back into the palace. The shepherd\nthen enters. Oedipus interrogates him, asking who gave him the baby. The\nshepherd refuses to disclose anything, and Oedipus threatens him\nwith torture. Finally, he answers that the child came from the house\nof Laius. Questioned further, he answers that the baby was in fact\nthe child of Laius himself, and that it was Jocasta who gave him the\ninfant, ordering him to kill it, as it had been prophesied that\nthe child would kill his parents.

Hearing that he is fated to kill his father,\nhe flees Corinth and, by a still more remarkable coincidence, ends\nup back in Thebes, now king and husband in his actual father’s place. Oedipus\nseems only to desire to flee his fate, but his fate continually catches\nup with him. Many people have tried to argue that Oedipus brings\nabout his catastrophe because of a “tragic flaw,” but nobody has\nmanaged to create a consensus about what Oedipus’s flaw actually\nis.

Antigone says that griefs are “handed down” in Oedipus’s\nfamily, implicitly comparing grief to a family heirloom.", "In her first speech, Antigone seems a dangerous woman,\nwell on her way to going over the edge. She knows she has nothing\nto lose, telling Ismene, “Do you know one, I ask you, one grief\n/ that Zeus will not perfect for the two of us / while we still\nlive and breathe?” Before we even have time to imagine what the\nnext grief might be, Antigone reveals it: Creon will not\nallow her brother Polynices to be buried. Ismene, on the other hand,\nlike the audience, is one step behind. From the outset, Antigone\nis the only one who sees what is really going on, the only one willing\nto speak up and point out the truth."], "Anarchy—show\nme a greater crime in all the earth! She, she destroys cities, rips\nup houses, breaks the ranks of spearmen into headlong rout. But\nthe ones who last it out, the great mass of them owe their lives\nto discipline. Therefore we must defend the men who live by law,\nnever let some woman triumph over us. Better to fall from power,\nif fall we must, at the hands of a man—never be rated inferior to\na woman, never. ( Antigone , 751–761) ": ["This is one of Creon’s speeches to the\nChorus. The word “anarchy” (in Greek, ", "anarchia", ")\nliterally means “without a leader.” The Greek word is feminine and\ncan be represented by a feminine pronoun, which is why Creon, speaking\nof anarchy, says, “She, she destroys cities, rips up houses. . .\n.” Because Creon uses the feminine pronoun, he sounds as if he might\nbe talking about Antigone, and maintaining order is certainly connected,\nin his mind, with keeping women in their place. Creon sees anarchy\nas the inevitable consequence when disobedience of the law is left\nunpunished. For Creon, the law, on whatever scale, must be absolute.\nHis insistence on the gender of the city’s ruler (“the man”) is\nsignificant, since masculine political authority is opposed to uncontrolled\nfeminine disobedience. Creon sees this feminine disobedience\nas something that upsets the order of civilization on every possible\nlevel—the political (“destroys cities”), the domestic (“rips up\nhouses”), and the military (“breaks the ranks of spearmen”). The\nonly way to fight this disorder is through discipline; therefore,\nsays Creon, “we must defend the men who live by law, [we must] never\nlet some woman triumph over us” (758)."], "Fear?\nWhat should a man fear? It’s all chance, chance rules our lives.\nNot a man on earth can see a day ahead, groping through the dark.\nBetter to live at random, best we can.

( Oedipus\nthe King , 1068–1078) ": ["The audience, familiar with the Oedipus\nstory, almost does not want to listen to these self-assured lines,\nspoken by Jocasta, wherein she treats incest with a startling lightness\nthat will come back to haunt her. What makes these lines tragic\nis that Jocasta has no reason to know that what she says is foolish,\nironic, or, simply, wrong. The audience’s sense of the work of “fate”\nin this play has almost entirely to do with the fact that the Oedipus\nstory was an ancient myth even in fifth-century ", "b.c.", " Athens.\nThe audience’s position is thus most like that of Tiresias—full\nof the knowledge that continues to bring it, and others, pain.", "At the same time, it is important to note that at least\npart of the irony of the passage does depend on the play, and the\naudience, faulting Jocasta for her blindness. Her claim that “chance\nrules our lives” and that Oedipus should live “as if there’s no\ntomorrow” seems to fly in the face of the beliefs of more or less\neveryone in the play, including Jocasta herself. Oedipus would not\nhave sent Creon to the oracle if he believed events were determined\nrandomly. Nor would he have fled Corinth after hearing the prophecy\nof the oracle that he would kill his father and sleep with his mother;\nnor would Jocasta have bound her baby’s ankles and abandoned him\nin the mountains. Again and again this play, and the other Theban\nplays, returns to the fact that prophecies do come true and that\nthe words of the gods must be obeyed. What we see in Jocasta is\na willingness to believe oracles only as it suits her: the oracle\nprophesied that her son would kill Laius and so she abandoned her\nson in the mountains; when Laius was not, as she thinks, killed\nby his son, she claims to find the words of the oracle worthless.\nNow she sees Oedipus heading for some potentially horrible revelation\nand seeks to curb his fear by claiming that everything a person\ndoes is random."], "People\nof Thebes, my countrymen, look on Oedipus. He solved the famous\nriddle with his brilliance, he rose to power, a man beyond all power.\nWho could behold his greatness without envy? Now what a black sea\nof terror has overwhelmed him. Now as we keep our watch and wait\nthe final day, count no man happy till he dies, free of pain at\nlast. ( Oedipus\nthe King , 1678–1684) ": ["These words, spoken by the Chorus, form\nthe conclusion of ", "Oedipus the King.", " That Oedipus\n“solved the famous riddle [of the Sphinx] with his brilliance” is\nan indisputable fact, as is the claim that he “rose to power,” to\nan enviable greatness. In underscoring these facts, the Chorus seems\nto suggest a causal link between Oedipus’s rise and his fall—that\nis, Oedipus fell ", "because", " he rose too high, because\nin his pride he inspired others to “envy.” But the causal relationship\nis never actually established, and ultimately all the Chorus demonstrates\nis a progression of time: “he rose to power, a man beyond all power.\n/ . . . / Now what a black sea of terror has overwhelmed him.” These\nlines have a ring of hollow and terrifying truth to them, because\nthe comfort an audience expects in a moral is absent (in essence,\nthey say “Oedipus fell for this reason; now you know how not to\nfall”)."], "Stop,\nmy children, weep no more. Here where the dark forces store up kindness\nboth for living and the dead, there is no room for grieving here—it\nmight bring down the anger of the gods. (Oedipus\nat Colonus, 1970–1974) ": ["Theseus’s short speech from the end\nof ", "Oedipus at Colonus", " argues that grieving might\nnot be a good thing—a sentiment unusual in the Theban plays. Sophocles’\naudience would have seen, before this speech, the most extreme consequences\nof excessive grief: Antigone’s death, Haemon’s death, Eurydice’s\ndeath, Jocasta’s death, Oedipus’s blinding, Oedipus’s self-exile.\nThe rash actions of the grief-stricken possess both a horror and\na sense of inevitability or rightness. Jocasta kills herself because\nshe cannot go on living as both wife and mother to her son; Oedipus\nblinds himself in order to punish himself for his blindness to his\nidentity; Eurydice can no longer live as the wife of the man who\nkilled her children. Theseus’s speech calls attention to the fact\nthat the violence that arises from this grieving only leads to the\nperpetuation of violence.", "At the end of ", "Oedipus at Colonus, ", "Antigone\nand Ismene beg to be allowed to see their father’s tomb, to complete\nthe process of their grieving at that spot. But Theseus insists\non maintaining the secret as Oedipus wished.

After the birth of her first child, Margery has a nervous\nbreakdown, seeing hideous devils all around her. Margery recovers after having a\nvision of Jesus Christ, and she decides to devote her life to holiness and\ncontemplation of God. One of the first hurdles Margery has to overcome is convincing\nher husband to live a life of celibacy with her—she succeeds only after having\nfourteen children. After the failure of a brewing business she starts, Margery\nbecomes certain that God wants her to turn away from the world. Margery’s devotion\nto Jesus is highly emotional and dramatic, and she soon acquires a reputation as a\nreligious eccentric, a potentially dangerous reputation in a time when heresy was a\ncapital offense. Margery faces doubt and temptation, especially sexual temptation,\nbut she perseveres and often receives guidance in her visions.", "\n", "Margery makes several pilgrimages, the longest and most difficult of which is\na journey to Jerusalem, with a long stopover in Rome.

In Jerusalem, Margery has several intense\nvisions, and she begins to have spells in which she sobs and cries uncontrollably.\nThese crying fits come upon her most often during religious services, but they also\noccur whenever she simply thinks of Jesus or sees something that reminds her of his\nsuffering. Margery is stranded in Rome for a time after giving away her money to the\npoor, and she makes her way by begging. Margery’s extreme behavior begins to make\nher notorious, and she makes enemies among the English contingent in Rome.\nEventually, Margery is given enough money to return home.", "\n", "Upon her return to England, Margery does her best to live a life of devotion\nto Christ.

Margery travels to various churches and holy\nsites in England, attracting attention wherever she goes, thanks to her public\nweeping and her all-white wardrobe. At times, Margery is accepted as a holy woman,\nand her advice and blessings are solicited. More often, she is treated as an oddity\nor a nuisance and mocked. On occasion, the hostile attention she draws goes beyond\nmockery. Traveling through the north of England, Margery is arrested several times\nand almost burned at the stake as a heretic, though she is saved by the intervention\nof the church authorities.

In her visions, Margery often sees\nherself as a servant to Mary or Jesus, acting as an eyewitness to the events of the\ngospels. Jesus speaks to Margery in her visions of such subjects as the Trinity, the\nsalvation and damnation of souls, and the meaning of the constant tears he sends\nher. Margery tries to spend as much time as she can in prayer or in conversation\nwith her spiritual guides.

The traditional form of such suffering occurs\nwhenever a Christian believer is persecuted for his or her beliefs, and the\nhallmark of a Christian martyr is a willingness to turn suffering and death\ninto a “witness” of faith (“martyr” means “witness”).

Margery’s absolute confidence in God’s\nblessing on her, in the form of her tears, is enough to give her the courage\nto stand up to, and even to rebuke, a man as imposing as the Archbishop. The\npoint of Margery’s statement is also important, hinting at the symbolic\nvalue of her tears as prayer. Someday, Margery is saying, the Archbishop\nwill wish that he had been as thoroughly attuned to the way Christ suffered\nfor his sake as Margery is.

We\nwould not suffer so much for any money on earth.” Then she said to them, “I do not suffer as much sorrow as I would do\nfor our Lord’s love, for I only suffer cutting words, and our merciful Lord\nChrist Jesus. . . . suffered hard strokes, bitter scourgings, and shameful\ndeath at the last, for me and for all mankind, blessed may he\nbe.” ": ["When Margery is arrested for the second time in Yorkshire, in Book\nOne, section 53, she faces ridicule for making such an unfeminine spectacle\nof herself and is urged to return home and take up her wifely duties once\nagain. Margery’s answer ignores the content of the men’s remarks, focusing\ninstead on the unspiritual small-mindedness revealed by their attitude\ntoward suffering. In response to their assertion that living as she does is\nsimply not worth the trouble, Margery invokes the crucified Jesus to ask, in\neffect, do you wish ", "he", " had chosen the easy path instead of\nthe way that leads to suffering? Seen in this light, Margery says, her own\nsuffering is nothing, and she can even gladly accept it as part of her\ndevotion to Christ."], "5. Then the lady’s priest came to her, saying, “Woman, Jesus is long\nsince dead.” When her crying ceased, she said to the priest, “Sir, his death is\nas fresh to me as if he had died this same day, and so, I think, it ought to\nbe to you and to all Christian people.” ": ["In Book One, section 60, Margery is again being challenged by a\nreligious figure for her emotional displays, in this case for weeping at the\nsight of a statue of Mary holding the dead Jesus. And again, Margery’s\nresponse is forthright and unafraid. Turning the priest’s question around,\nshe shifts the issue from the impropriety of her unusual reaction to the\ndeath of Jesus to the fact that her response is, indeed, so unusual. Why,\nMargery wants to know, doesn’t everybody cry when they think of Jesus—that’s\nthe real question. Margery’s tears once again take on their symbolic,\ndidactic value. She cries because she sees Christ’s sacrifice as occurring\neven now, and eternally—which is in fact what Christians profess to believe.\nThe greatest spiritual danger for a Christian is to forget about Christ, and\nMargery’s greatest ambition is to become a living reminder of his\nlove."]}}}

El Sordo agrees to\nhelp with the mission, but both he and Robert Jordan are troubled\nby the fact that the bridge must be blown in daylight, which will make\ntheir retreat more difficult. On the way back to Pablo’s camp, Robert\nJordan and Maria make love in the forest. When they catch up with\nPilar, Maria confesses to Pilar that the earth moved as they made\nlove.

He wakes up Maria, and as they make love, they feel\nthe earth move again. Pablo suddenly returns just before dawn, claiming\nthat he left in a moment of weakness.

The passage gives us a glimpse of what may have caused\nRobert Jordan to leave his life and job in the states to volunteer\nto fight in a foreign war: he sought something to believe in “wholly\nand completely” and also sought communion, an “absolute brotherhood”\nwith other people. But his disillusionment with the “bureaucracy\nand inefficiency and party strife” he sees in the Republican cause\nand its leaders foreshadows his current opinion that the leaders\nhave “betrayed” their people. The religious vocabulary\nHemingway uses, such as “crusade,” “communion,” “consecration,”\nemphasizes the depth of Robert Jordan’s feelings and suggests that,\nfor many people, the Republican cause became a substitute religion.\nBut Robert Jordan’s use of religious language is accompanied by\na touch of irony, since he immediately distances himself from using\nreligious metaphors, which he characterizes as “embarrassing.” This\nconstant qualification of exactly what he means is typical of Robert\nJordan’s monologues.

Through his relationship with Maria,\nRobert Jordan finds love in which he can believe fully, love that\nhe can integrate into his life. He also feels as if he has found\nfamily—an absolute brotherhood—with the guerrilleros: “I have been\nall my life in these hills. . . . Anselmo is my oldest friend. .\n. .

In this passage, which comes directly\nafterward, Robert Jordan reflects on the particular nature of Spaniards.\nHe believes that, as a race, they have an innate, pre-Christian,\nvisceral desire to kill that has surfaced periodically throughout\nhistory. He references the Spanish Inquisition, the state-sponsored\nbrutal persecution of Jews and other non-Catholics that was practiced\nin Spain from the Renaissance through the beginning of the nineteenth\ncentury. Robert Jordan ends by forcing himself to face\nup to the fact that he, too, has felt the urge and excitement of\nkilling. In several instances throughout the novel, most notably\nin the language that he uses to describe Andrés’s memories of bull-baiting\nin his hometown in Chapter Thirty-four, Hemingway draws parallels\nbetween the drive to kill and the desire for sex. Through this parallel,\nHemingway establishes yet another connection between death and sex,\na major motif in the novel."], "“Pasionaria\nsays ‘Better to die on thy—’” Joaquín was saying to himself as the\ndrone came nearer them.

The quotation, spoken by El Sordo’s\nyoung companion Joaquín, starkly illustrates the inadequacies of\nthe Republican government and its leadership in the war. The Republican government\noutlawed religion when it came to power six years earlier, and the\nteenage Joaquín came of age under its propaganda. He clings to Republican\nrhetoric throughout the attack on the hill, despite the laughter\nof his older and more cynical comrades. The Republicans’ empty words\nprove to be cold comfort as Joaquín faces death. Hemingway views\nthis empty rhetoric as a betrayal of the true needs of the Spanish\npeasants, who had grown up with religion and see it as a comfort.\nIndeed, as Joaquín faces death, he remembers his Catholic childhood—his\nbeliefs before the Republicans outlawed religion—and prays to the\nVirgin Mary. Likewise, Anselmo turns to prayer as he beholds the\nbeheaded Joaquín and his comrades not long after.

For the first time, he feels “completely integrated” with\nhis world.", " Having rejected Communism sometime before the start of\nthe novel, Robert Jordan now embraces not some abstract idea of\na brotherhood of men but the concrete human relationships he has forged\nwith a specific group of guerrilleros. After long proclaiming that\nhe does not believe in Pilar’s signs and omens, he now accepts the\npossibility that “[the gypsies] see something.

The phrase\nstructures are the simplest possible—there are no commas. The sentence structure’s\nonly complexity, the tendency toward run-ons, gives the sentences\na concrete, physical shape, like a flowing river. Also typical of\nHemingway, the simplicity of the grammar hides the depth of feeling\njust below the surface: Robert Jordan touches the elements of his\nphysical world, one by one, including the ever-present pines, in\na gesture of final farewell.

Joff Lannister, who is still a young boy, has recently become king, but Stannis Baratheon and Renly Baratheon both want the crown for themselves. Robb Stark, meanwhile, has recently taken the title of King of the North. Far to the north of this action, the men of the Night’s Watch leave the safety of the Wall to investigate the disappearance of the wilding people, enemies who live in primitive bands and villages in the vast wilderness north of the Wall.

At Winterfell, young Bran Stark chafes as he is left in charge. In his dreams, he inhabits the body of his direwolf, Summer. Jojen and Meera Reed arrive at Winterfell, and the three bond over Jojen and Bran’s supernatural powers. Vainglorious Theon then attacks Winterfell, seizing Bran and Rickon as hostages. He pretends to kill Bran and Rickon, which disgusts everyone. Theon lacks men and enters into an alliance with a group led by Ramsay Bolton. This group turns on Theon, takes him captive, and decimates Winterfell. Bran, Hodor, and the Reeds escape Winterfell and head to the Wall, where Jojen will continue Bran’s mystical training.

She flees with Brienne of Tarth, a female knight who was part of Renly's guard. Storm’s End finally falls after Ser Davos takes Melisandre below the castle at night, where he watches her give birth to a shadow assassin much like the one Catelyn saw.

He fortifies the city, forging alliances with two powerful members of the royal council, Littlefinger and Varys, and banishing, killing, or imprisoning those who have committed crimes, even if said crimes were committed at Cersei’s behest.

Arya and her friends are captured and taken to Harrenhal to work as servants. Jaqen arrives at Harrenhal as part of a group called the Brave Companions. When he spots Arya, he promises to kill any three people Arya names in return for her saving his life and the lives of his friends. Arya has Jaqen kill two people, then forces Jaqen to help her free a group of Northmen who she believes will help her return to Winterfell.

Jeor Mormont sends Jon Snow and Qhorin Halfhand as reconnaissance scouts. The pair discover that the wildings are moving. Jon has a dream in which he becomes Ghost, his direwolf. Later, the events of the dream come true, implying that Jon, like his half-brother Bran, is a warg (skinchanger).

War causes immense suffering, and that suffering gets compounded by the fact that the confusion of battle and military maneuverings means that characters constantly act in ignorance of the full state of affairs. During battle, no one really has any idea what is happening, as Martin shows in the experiences of Davos and Tyrion. The battle scenes involving both men are extraordinarily chaotic. But even before battle has begun, basic questions like where rival armies are located cannot be reliably answered. Rumors also proliferate about who is alive and dead without any way to tell what’s true from what’s false. The main means of communication in Westeros is raven, and so information takes days to travel from one place to another. Robb and Tywin take advantage of the confusion and the lack of reliable information to launch stunning sneak attacks. Because the reader sees events in the novel through the eyes of the character, the reader is also often unaware of what is happening in other regions of the kingdom.", "Additionally, war, the novel suggests, is not just chaotic for the participants, but also for the innocent bystanders caught in its path. As Arya heads north to the Wall, for instance, she and her group encounter several destroyed or abandoned villages whose residents have been displaced by the fighting. Outlaws use the turmoil of the war to raid and loot, and it becomes clear that nobody can be trusted. The war turns all certainty and morality on its head, leaving everyone distrusting everyone else and taking advantage of any situation they can."], "Disadvantage as a Source of Power": ["Many characters in the novel have a disability or social disadvantage of some kind: Tyrion has dwarfism, Bran cannot use his legs, Jon is a bastard. While such disadvantages often get presented as weaknesses, Martin shows that they can actually be sources of strength. Tyrion, for instance, develops his mind in lieu of his body, and becomes the most intelligent character in the novel, one who lives by his wit. Bran initially suffers greatly because of his paralysis, as it destroys his dream of becoming a knight. But with the help of Jojen Reed, Bran learns to thrive in a different way, by getting in touch with a rare ability deep within himself, one that makes him much more powerful than he would be if he was not disabled. Jon finds that his social status doesn’t matter in the Night’s Watch, and he earns the respect of his peers and commanders alike. With these characters, Martin inverts expectations and reveals that deviations from the norm need not be drawbacks at all, but can actually be virtues."], "The Necessity of Confronting Difficult Truths": ["Martin’s novel abounds with young characters who have to mature quickly, and with these characters he shows the importance of learning to confront, and ultimately accept, harsh truths. Bran, for instance, must learn to accept his paralysis so that he can move past it, and once he does he begins to thrive again. The theme reaches its clearest expression in the character of Sansa, who has long believed in idealistic and romantic tales of virtuous knights, beautiful ladies, and true love. Sansa thought that going to King’s Landing would allow her to live out such stories, but instead she sees that knights are just people, complicated and often duplicitous, that ladies can be scheming and cruel, and that love can be a fraud enacted for personal gain. Sansa has a hard time abandoning her childish view, but the novel demonstrates that she must if she hopes to survive in the court at King’s Landing, where she is held hostage."]}}, "quotes": {"link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/a-clash-of-kings/quotes/", "important_quotations_explained": {"1. “Here, then. Power resides where men believe it resides. No more and no less.” “So power is a mummer’s trick?” “A shadow on the wall,” Varys murmured, “yet shadows can kill. And ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow.” ": ["This conversation between Varys and Tyrion occurs immediately after Tyrion has replaced Janos Slynt with Jacelyn Bywater as the commander of the City Watch. Varys poses Tyrion a riddle about which is strongest, political power, religious power, or economic power. The riddle leads them to discuss the nature of power and how it gets exercised. Varys puts forward the view that the perception of being powerful, rather than any absolute measure of power, is what makes someone powerful. Tyrion expresses some skepticism about this notion, but Varys insists that although it makes power sound illusory, illusions can kill.", "The quotation makes explict an issue that runs throughout the book, namely characters’ efforts to manipulate their and others' images for gain. Theon, for instance, wants people to fear and respect him, so he acts in ways that he thinks will make him appear intimidating. Stannis wants to be recognized as the rightful king, so he helps spread the rumor that Joffrey is born of incest. (Of course, this point is true, but it is not generally perceived as being true.) While the novel seems sympathetic to Varys’s argument that power depends on perception, it also shows the difficulty of controlling perception, and thus the difficulty of wielding power effectively. Ironically, the character who seems to be most loathed by his subjects, Tyrion, winds up exercising power more skillfully than anyone else in the novel. The novel thus suggests that while there is definitely a relationship between power and perception, it is a thorny, complicated one that few people can manage well."], "2. “Kings have no friends,” Stannis said bluntly, “only subjects and enemies.” ": ["Stannis makes this remark to Catelyn at the parley with Renly, after she says that Robb, the King in the North, holds out his hand in friendship to everyone. At its heart, ", "A Clash of Kings", " is a story about people grappling for power and authority, and this quotation presents one of the costs of that struggle. The desire for power, it suggests, leaves no room for love or friendship. Stannis intends his quip simply as a dismissal of Robb’s gesture, which he sees as naive, but it has a particular relevance to his own situation. Stannis has the most legitimate claim to the Iron Throne, but he has trouble rallying supporters, as people find him personally distasteful. He claims to be uninterested in whether people like him so long as they obey him. Having alienated so many potential supporters, however, Stannis finds his path to the throne a difficult one. His hardness and ambition have left him with a few subjects and many enemies.", "This desire for power above all else appears in multiple characters. Joffrey, who is currently the ruling king of Westeros, faces a similar situation in that he views others only as subjects or enemies. Theon, too, sacrifices all else for his ambition. Though he was raised among the Starks and grew so close to the family that Robb considered him like a brother, his ambition caused him to throw away that bond and try instead to claim Winterfell as his own. Notably, the only king in Westeros who does appear to have genuine friends is Robb Stark, and he was elevated to his position almost democratically, as the Northmen selected him."], "3. “Winterfell’s not in the south,” Jon objected. “Yes it is. Everything below the Wall’s south to us.” He had never thought of it that way. “I suppose it’s all in where you’re standing.” “Aye,” Ygritte agreed. “It always is.” ": ["This conversation between Jon and Ygritte, which occurs after Jon and Stonesnake  capture the wildling woman, refers to the importance of perspective in determining what one considers the truth. Ygritte gets Jon to see that the view of reality a person takes depends on that person’s subjective perspective. The novel itself illustrates this point many times, as characters take radically different views of incidents, developments, and especially other people as a result of their personal biases. Catelyn, for example, sees the Lannisters as essentially evil. So deeply does she feel this that she views Littlefinger’s suggestion that Tyrion plotted Bran’s murder as unquestionably true. Only when she hears Jaime's perspective does she see that her view may have been incomplete and incorrect. The novel demonstrates the importance of perspective by telling its story through point-of-view chapters following different characters. There is no omniscient narrator to tell readers what the real state of affairs is. Instead, the novel shows readers how the world looks from a variety of perspectives, and leaves readers to evaluate those perspectives in order to uncover the truth."], "4. “There are no true knights, no more than there are gods. If you can’t protect yourself, die and get out of the way of those who can. Sharp steel and strong arms rule this world, don’t ever believe any different.” ": ["The Hound says these words to Sansa just before he leaves her at the end of the novel. The quotation is tied to one of the book’s central themes, the importance of accepting hard truths. Sansa wants very much to believe in an idealized version of the world based on songs and stories. A central component of many of these songs and stories is the chivalrous knight, who is courageous, virtuous, and protects those weaker than himself (and who is often handsome). Sansa often longs for a knight to come rescue her, but here the Hound here tells Sansa that this sort of knight, and by extension her romanticized view of the world, is a fantasy. Knights, he suggests, are above all trained killers. They don't protect the weak, as Sansa would like to believe, but rather destroy them, and in the Hound's formulation, they are right to do so. What he implies is that if Sansa wants to survive, she must give up her fantasy and see the world as it really is. More than that, she must be willing to fend for herself, as she cannot count on anyone else to protect her."], "5. The stone is strong, Bran told himself, the roots of the trees go deep, and under the ground the Kings of Winter sit their thrones. So long as those remained, Winterfell remained. It was not dead, just broken. Like me, he thought. I’m not dead either.  ": ["This quotation ends the novel. Bran leaves Winterfell with Hodor, Summer, and the Reeds, and as he looks back at the castle, he sees that while it may have taken a beating, it still stands. The quote draws a direct parallel between Bran and his family's home, and it foreshadows that both Winterfell and Bran will ultimately be restored to their former strength. Bran derives this realization from the knowledge of himself he has gained over the course of the novel. He thought his life had more or less ended when he lost the use of his legs, as his disability meant giving up his dream of becoming a knight. But he has gradually come to understand that he can transcend his physical state and that he need not be defined by his injuries. The most influential factor in Bran's realization is the telepathic bond he now shares with his direwolf, Summer, which quite literally allows him to escape the limitations of his body by inhabiting another. Bran has consequently realized that his life still has value, even if it isn't the life he would have chosen for himself. The book's final lines ecapsulate this sense of resilience, and the parallel drawn between Bran and Winterfell implies that perhaps it will be Bran who restores the Stark home to its past glory."]}}}

Because they are evenly matched, Enkidu\nputs a check on Gilgamesh’s restless, powerful energies, and Gilgamesh\npulls Enkidu out of his self-centeredness. Gilgamesh’s connection\nto Enkidu makes it possible for Gilgamesh to identify with his people’s\ninterests. The love the friends have for each other makes Gilgamesh\na better man in the first half of the epic, and when Enkidu dies,\nGilgamesh’s grief and terror impel him onto a futile quest for immortality.

Shamash, the sun god, consoles Enkidu by reminding\nhim how rich his life has been, but though Enkidu finally resigns\nhimself to his fate, Gilgamesh is terrified by the thought of his\nown. Mesopotamian theology offers a vision of an afterlife, but\nit gives scant comfort—the dead spend their time being dead. If\nGilgamesh’s quest to the Cedar Forest was in spite of death, his\nsecond quest, to Utnapishtim, is for a way to escape it. Utnapishtim’s\naccount of the flood reveals how ludicrous such a goal is, since\ndeath is inextricably woven into the fabric of creation. But life\nis woven in as well, and even though humans die, humanity continues\nto live. The lesson that Gilgamesh brings back from his quest isn’t\nultimately about death—it’s about life."], "The Gods Are Dangerous": ["Gilgamesh and Enkidu learn all too well that the gods\nare dangerous for mortals.

Harry’s humility is no\ndoubt ingrained in him during his ten miserable years of neglect\nand cruelty with the Dursleys. But Harry does not stop being humble\nwhen he gains fame, wealth, and popularity at Hogwarts. His reaction\nto the discovery that everyone seems to know his name on the train\nto Hogwarts does not make him primp and pose, but rather only makes\nhim hope that he can manage to live up to his reputation. In this\nrespect, he contrasts sharply with Draco Malfoy, who prides himself\non his family reputation and downplays achievement.", "\tSimilarly, when it becomes apparent that Harry has an\nastounding gift for Quidditch, his reaction is not to glory in his\nsuperstar abilities, but rather to practice more industriously than\nbefore. When Harry breaks Quidditch records by catching the Golden Snitch\nin the first five minutes of the game, he does not even pause to appreciate\nthe applause of the crowd, but rushes off. Harry’s refusal to glorify\nhimself is instrumental in getting the stone because he differs\nfrom wicked wizards like Quirrell in that he desires only to find the\nStone for the common good, not to use it to acquire personal fame\nor fortune. If Harry were less humble, he would be unable to seize\nthe stone.

Even at the highest\nlevel of the Hogwarts administration, there is a clear respect for\nthe rules. Dumbledore is a stern taskmaster. He makes a very gentle\nand warm welcome speech to the first-year students, but he throws\nin a few menacing reminders about the prohibition of visits to the\nForbidden Forest and the third-floor corridor. None of these Hogwarts\nrules ever seems arbitrary or unfair. On the contrary, we generally approve\nof them, feeling that in a world imperiled by misused magic, strict\ncontrol over student behavior is necessary.", "\tEven so, it soon becomes clear that Harry is unable to\nabide perfectly by the rules.

Rather, they enhance his heroism because they\nshow that he is able to think for himself and make his own judgments.\nThe contrast to Harry in this respect is the perfectionist Hermione,\nwho never breaks a rule at the beginning and who is thus annoying\nto both Harry and us. When she eventually lies to a teacher, showing that\nshe too can transcend the rules, Hermione becomes Harry’s friend.\nOne of the main lessons of the story is that while rules are good\nand necessary, sometimes it is necessary to question and even break\nthem for the right reasons."], "The Dangers of Desire ": ["As the pivotal importance of the desire-reflecting Mirror\nof Erised reveals, learning what to want is an important part of\none’s development. Excessive desire is condemned from the story’s\nbeginning, as the spoiled Dudley’s outrageous demands for multiple\ntelevision sets appear foolish and obnoxious. The same type of greed\nappears later in a much more evil form in the power-hungry desires\nof Voldemort, who pursues the Sorcerer’s Stone’s promise of unlimited wealth\nand life. While Voldemort and Dudley are obviously different in\nother respects, they share an uncontrollable desire that repels Harry\nand makes him the enemy of both of them. Desire is not necessarily\nwrong or bad, as Dumbledore explains to Harry before the Mirror\nof Erised—Harry’s desire to see his parents alive is touching and\nnoble. But overblown desire is dangerous in that it can make people\nlose perspective on life, which is why Dumbledore advises Harry\nnot to seek out the mirror again. Dumbledore himself illustrates\nthe power and grandeur of one who has renounced desires almost completely\nwhen he says that all he wants is a pair of warm socks.

": ["Dumbledore’s impatient reproach to Professor\nMcGonagall occurs in Chapter 1, when they\nand Hagrid appear in front of the Dursleys’ house to discuss the\nsudden tragic deaths of Harry’s parents. The passage reveals Dumbledore’s\ncomposure even after a hugely traumatic event like an evil wizard’s\nmurder of two innocent people: he is calmly using phrases like “My\ndear Professor” and eating candy, while McGonagall is flinching\nwith nervousness. We see clearly why Dumbledore is head wizard and\nMcGonagall his subordinate.", "The passage also reveals the importance of facing one’s\nenemies directly. For all of McGonagall’s education and expertise,\nshe is unable to speak Voldemort’s name out loud, as are many other\nHogwarts residents. The implication is that they are too scared\nto utter the name. Harry, we find out later, is, by contrast, not\nscared at all; his friends keep urging him to say “You-Know-Who”\ninstead of “Voldemort,” but he sees no reason to do so, and keeps\nforgetting. When Harry calls Voldemort by his proper name, we get\na hint that Harry will be the one who can face the evil wizard directly,\nas he in fact does when he stares at Voldemort’s face on the back\nof Quirrell’s head.

Hagrid’s surprise at Harry’s ignorance of himself\nand of his family underscores the separation of the Muggle and the\nwizard worlds. Being famous among wizards does not necessarily imply\nbeing famous among ordinary humans. Despite all the vast powers\nof the wizards, the Hogwarts officials have been unable to penetrate\nthe defenses of stupid and selfish Muggles like the Dursleys, who\nhave, quite impressively, kept Harry’s uniqueness a secret from\nhim for ten whole years. The intense Muggle dread of being different\nand the powerfully oppressive denials of how Harry is special are\nactually quite a match for all the wizards at Hogwarts. In Hagrid’s\nastonishment that one could be a wizard without realizing it, we\nsee how stifling and constraining human society can be, at least\nin the Dursley household.", "\tHagrid’s reference to Harry’s parents in connection with\nHarry’s own fame foreshadows one important aspect of Harry’s upcoming adventures.\nHis experiences at Hogwarts will prove how talented Harry is (“You’re\nfamous”), but they will also re-establish the connection that has\nbeen lost between Harry and his real family.

": ["Harry has this dream at the end of Chapter 7,\nand it reveals much not only about Harry’s fate and his situation,\nbut also about Harry’s own challenge in having to deal with such\na burden. Before describing this dream, the narrator suggests that\nthe dream comes perhaps because Harry has eaten too much, but we\nknow better. We understand that Harry is wrestling with some very\ndifficult issues that are affecting his dreams. His dream of Quirrell\nis prophetic, as Harry discovers only in Chapter 17 that\nQuirrell, not Snape, is behind the evil plot; perhaps he suspected\nQuirrell unconsciously all along. The talking turban clearly reminds\nus of the Sorting Hat, which represents fate for Harry in assigning\nhim to a house at Hogwarts.", "\tThe turban also reminds us how Voldemort talks to Harry\nmuch later from under Quirrell’s turban and how Voldemort and his\nevil green light are also part of Harry’s fate. But even fate is\nnot so easy to understand, as we recall that Harry is able to persuade\nthe hat to assign him to Gryffindor rather than Slytherin; perhaps\nfate can be changed through personal actions, just as Harry tries\nto pull off the turban of destiny in his dream. Finally, the presence\nof Malfoy in Harry’s dream shows that his adventure in solving the\nSorcerer’s Stone mystery is intertwined with his more everyday task\nof having social interactions, choosing friends, and facing down\none’s enemies. Malfoy plays no part in Voldemort’s plot, but he\nseems important to Harry nevertheless, as one of the many confusing\nfactors in Harry’s attempt to make sense of his Hogwarts experience."], "Your\nfather left this in my possession before he died.

The cloak also becomes an important symbol of the relationship\nbetween Harry and Albus Dumbledore when we find out later that it\nis Dumbledore who has given the cloak to Harry. It symbolizes Dumbledore’s growing\ntrust in Harry, as the great wizard surely knows that giving a boy\nthe gift of invisibility is bound to lead to some naughtiness, which\nit in fact does. Dumbledore may caution Harry to “[u]se it well,”\nbut in all his wisdom he must realize that Harry will use it wrongly,\nbreaking into the restricted-books section of the library and hauling\nan illegal dragon across the campus.", "\tYet, in the long run, Dumbledore’s trust in Harry is\njustified, because Harry does learn finally to use the cloak—and\nall his magic gifts—toward the right ends. His disaster in being\ncaught and punished after the dragon incident, when he stupidly\nforgets to wear the cloak, forces him to think more carefully about\nthe consequences of his actions. We sense that Harry’s education\nin personal responsibility is all part of Dumbledore’s grand plan\nin giving Harry the cloak, because after the dragon affair Dumbledore\nreturns the cloak to Harry neatly folded. With it, Dumbledore places\nhis own vote of confidence in Harry."], "After\nall, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. ": ["Dumbledore makes this remark to Harry\nin Chapter 17, when Harry is in the hospital,\nin reference to the imminent death of Nicolas Flamel, Dumbledore’s\nold partner and inventor of the Sorcerer’s Stone. When Dumbledore\nannounces that he and Flamel have decided to thwart Voldemort by\ndestroying the stone, and with it the possibility of attaining eternal\nlife, Harry realizes that Flamel will die. Flamel is effectively\nsacrificing himself for the good of Hogwarts and of the world, just\nas Jesus Christ, according to Christian belief, was supposed to\nhave sacrificed himself for the salvation of humankind. Flamel’s\ndecision reveals his wisdom, all the more so as Dumbledore’s words\necho the thoughts of innumerable philosophers and religious figures\n(from the Greek Socrates to the Indian Buddha) who have similarly\nseen death as a beginning rather than an end.", "Dumbledore’s and Flamel’s wisdom is precisely what is\nlacking in a villain like Voldemort, who clings unnaturally to life,\nrefusing to accept the natural human adventure of death. By saying\nthat a healthy acceptance of death is a characteristic of a “well-organized mind,”\nDumbledore is implying that Voldemort’s manic pursuit of immortality\nis not well organized at all, despite all of his savvy tricks, but\nis rather deranged."]}}}

The full extent and nature of the Ring’s power\nnever becomes entirely clear to us, but we get the sense that the\nRing symbolizes a power almost without limits, and which is utterly\ncorrupting. It is immensely difficult for many of the characters\nto resist the temptation to take the Ring for themselves and use\nit for their own ends. Regardless of the wearer’s initial intentions,\ngood or evil, the Ring’s power always turns the wearer to evil.\nIndeed, even keeping the Ring is dangerous. ", "The Fellowship\nof the Ring", " is strewn with examples of those who are corrupted\nby the Ring. The power of the Ring transformed the Black Riders,\nonce human kings, into fearsome, undead Ringwraiths. Gollum, once\na young boy named Sméagol, killed his friend Déagol for the Ring\nand then gradually became a wretched, crouching, froglike creature\nwho thinks only of his desire to retrieve the Ring for himself.\nDuring the travels of the Fellowship, Boromir grows increasingly\ncorrupted by the proximity of the Ring, wanting to use its power\nto destroy Sauron rather than destroy the Ring itself, as Elrond\nand Gandalf have advised; ultimately, the Ring leads Boromir to\ndesire it for himself. For many, the great power offered by the\nRing overrides all rational thought. The power of the Ring is by\nno means the only temptation in Middle-earth—the Dwarves of Moria,\nfor example, coveted ", "mithril", " too much, and they\ndug so deep that they awakened the Balrog beneath them—but the Ring\nis the greatest temptation and therefore the greatest threat."], "The Inevitability of Decline": ["The Middle-earth of ", "The Lord of the Rings", " is\na world on the cusp of a transformation. After the events the novel\ndescribes, the age of the Elves will pass and the age of Men will\ndawn. A large portion of the story eulogizes this passing age of\nthe Elves. The Elves and their realms have a beauty and grace unmatched\nby anything else in Middle-earth. Though the Elves themselves are\nimmortal, as Galadriel tells us, the destruction of Sauron’s One\nRing will weaken the Three Elven Rings, forcing the Elves to leave\nMiddle-earth and fade away. Throughout the novel, Tolkien gives\nus the sense that the adventures of the Ring represent the last\nburst of a sort of magic that will not be found in the world that\ncomes afterward. This later world will be a world without Sauron,\nbut also a world without Lothlórien. Even in chapters about the\nHobbits and the lowly Shire, we sense that we are witnessing something\ngood and pure that is, for whatever reason, no longer present in\nthis world. The Hobbits, the narrator tells us, have become somewhat\nestranged from Men in the times since ", "The Lord of the Rings", " took\nplace, and now avoid us “with dismay.”"], "The Power of Myth": ["The sense of transience and lost grandeur that pervades ", "The\nLord of the Rings", " goes, in part, with the territory in\nwhich Tolkien is wading. He writes the novel in a mythic mode, and\none of the conventions of myth is that it describes a past that\nis more glorious than the present. This sense of loss certainly\nis present in the Greek myths, for example, or in Homer’s epic poems\nthat draw on these myths—both of which describe a world in which\nmen and gods mix freely, a world that is no more. Tolkien’s own\nwork is something between mythology and fiction, locating itself\nin a middle ground between a past that is remembered only in song\nand the everyday present of the reader. This sense of ancientness\nis constantly present, brought to life in chants, poems, and graven\ninscriptions. As Tolkien shows again and again—whether with the\nElves or with the Númenóreans or the Dwarves—the stories that the\ncharacters tell define them. In some cases, as with Aragorn for\nexample, this mythology explains not only where a character comes\nfrom, but also where he or she is going. The characters carry their\npast and their lore around with them, and they are virtually unable\nto speak without referring to this lore. The twist Tolkien adds\nis that these “myths,” while retaining all of the usual metaphorical\nresonance and symbolic simplicity, also happen to be true—at least\nin his world. This sense of reality within the novel, in turn, lends\npower to even the most everyday occurrences in Middle-earth."]}}, "quotes": {"link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/fellowship/quotes/", "important_quotations_explained": {"“I\nwish it need not have happened in my time,” said Frodo. “So\ndo I,” said Gandalf, “and so do all who live to see such times.\nBut that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what\nto do with the time that is given us.” ": ["This exchange occurs in Book I, Chapter ", "2", ",\nas Gandalf explains the history of the Ring to Frodo. The “it” to\nwhich Frodo refers is the finding of the Ring by Gollum, as well\nas the return of Sauron. Gandalf’s response to Frodo’s lament is\nat once heroic and fatalistic. The wizard’s words are heroic because\nthey insist that one must rise to the challenge offered by one’s\ntime. At the same time, however, there is also the suggestion that\none is born at a particular time and in a particular place for a\ncertain preordained purpose. The decision is, of course, not one’s\nown to make; however, Gandalf does imply that it is a decision that\nis made", " somewhere", "—that Gandalf and Frodo’s “time”\nhas been “given” to them. This sense of purpose, of fate assigning\nroles to certain people, surfaces in many other such passages in ", "The\nLord of the Rings,", " in which ancient prophecies assign characters\nto certain tasks. Indeed, as Aragorn says, the War of the Ring is\nfated to be Gandalf’s greatest battle. These pervasive references\nto preordainment and prophecy link Tolkien’s novel to earlier epics\nand mythologies, most notably those of ancient Greece. Like many\nof the characters in ", "The Lord of the Rings,", " the\nGreek gods and mortals are at the mercy of fate, often in the form\nof prophecies made long before the characters were even alive. Despite\nthis emphasis on fate, however, free will does play a significant\npart in Tolkien’s novel. Frodo is perhaps the ideal Ring-bearer,\nas his strength of character enables him to accept his fated role,\nyet also to retain a sense of free will in the face of the powerful,\ncorrupting influence of the Ring."], "“Many\nthat live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you\ngive it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement.\nFor even the very wise cannot see all ends.” ": ["Later in the same conversation in Book\nI, Chapter ", "2", ", Gandalf again explores—though\nthis time more dimly—the hand of fate in the world of Middle-earth.\nThe wizard’s words are again a gentle rebuke to Frodo, who bemoans\nthe fact that Gandalf did not kill Gollum when he had the chance,\neven though the wretched creature “deserves” death. Though Gandalf\ndoes not know how exactly, he does have a sense that Gollum has\nsome further role to play in the story of the Ring. Indeed, as we\nsee later in ", "The Two Towers", " and ", "The Return\nof the King,", " the wizard is correct. On a plot level, predictions such\nas Gandalf’s serve to maintain suspense and create a sense of foreboding\nor anticipation, foreshadowing coming events but not telling us\nwhether they are near or distant. On a more figurative level, however,\nTolkien uses these prophecies and predictions to remind us of the\npresence of fate, which has assigned roles to all of the characters—roles\nthat even the wisest and most powerful among them do not yet know\nor understand."], "“[Bilbo]\nused to say there was only one Road; that it was like a great river:\nits springs were at every doorstep, and every path was its tributary.” ": ["\n", "The Lord of the Rings", " is\na quest narrative, as the characters spend much of their time on\nthe road, traveling toward the various destinations to which the\nquest takes them.

Here, as Frodo quotes Bilbo just as the hobbits set\nout in Book I, Chapter ", "3", ", Tolkien creates\nan image of the road as a river, carrying its travelers along in\nits current. This current works at the narrative level to advance\nthe plot, keeping the Fellowship moving into fresh encounters and\noftentimes into the unknown. Furthermore, the road serves as one\nof the most potent and charged metaphors in all of ", "The Lord\nof the Rings.", " In part, the road represents the passing\nof time and the ages that time sweeps into the past, just as the\nroad sweeps travelers off into the distant horizon. The road also represents\nthe interconnectedness of all things, the fact that even the smallest\nfootpath in the Shire leads, through many merges and branches, to\nthe most distant and sinister places in Middle-earth. Though the\nShire itself may be a place of comfort and familiarity, the road\nserves as a subtle yet constant reminder that the unknown outside\nworld is present, and merely a journey away."], " All\nthat is gold does not glitter,\nNot all those who wander are lost . . .  ": ["These lines are the beginning of a poem\nabout Aragorn, quoted by Gandalf in his letter to Frodo in Book\nI, Chapter ", "10", ", and offered as a means for\nthe hobbit to determine whether Strider is indeed Aragorn. The poem\ndemonstrates not only Tolkien’s facility with language, but also\nthe central place of poetry, lore, and prophecy in the world of\nMiddle-earth. The verse functions as a sort of seal of authenticity\nfor Aragorn, one that defines him not only through his past and\nlineage, but also through his future—the destiny that awaits him.\nStylistically, the poem shows Tolkien at his mythic-poetic best.\nIn opening the poem with an inversion of a widely known aphorism\n(“all that glitters is not gold”)—a move that also sets the metric\nrhythm for the poem—Tolkien grounds the poem in the known before\nusing it to lay out part of his own created mythology. In this case,\nthe mythology is the story of the return of the king to Minas Tirith\nand the reforging of the sword of Elendil. Tolkien uses this technique\nof grounding the mythic in the known many times throughout the novel.\nPerhaps the most notable arena for this technique is in Tolkien’s\ndescriptions of the natural world of Middle-earth, which mix familiar\nelements, such as birds, horses, and willow and fir trees, with\nthe unfamiliar or scary, such as Orcs, ", "athelas", " and ", "mellyrn", " trees,\nand the Balrog. This blending of elements enhances the believability\nof Tolkien’s Middle-earth, making it easier to swallow than a world\nin which literally everything is unfamiliar—and perhaps even characterizing\nMiddle-earth as a sort of ancient predecessor to our own world."], "For\nso it seemed to them: Lórien was slipping backward, like a bright\nship masted with enchanted trees, sailing on to forgotten shores,\nwhile they sat helpless upon the margin of the grey and leafless\nworld.

Leaving the beautiful realm is painful for\nall of the members of the Fellowship, even Gimli, whose people,\nthe Dwarves, have a long-standing animosity with the Elves of Lórien.\nThe departure of the Company also has a broader significance, as\nit represents the more general fading away of the Elves and their\nrealm. Tolkien uses the flowing Anduin to good effect in this description\nof transience and impermanence. To the departing travelers, it seems\nas if Lórien itself is sailing away like a ship, rather than the\nCompany sailing away from it. This manner of description alludes\nto the fact that the Elves, if they survive the War of the Ring,\nplan to take to ships and cross the sea away from Middle-earth forever.\nThe river’s current also symbolizes the passage of time—a convention\nof countless songs and poems—that sweeps the world before it, but\nleaves the Elves behind. Indeed, throughout the novel, the Elves\noccupy an unusual position as immortal beings whose creations are\noften nonetheless fragile and impermanent.

Earlier norms of hospitality\ntoward strangers have been abandoned because of the new dangers\nof the modern age, as Éomer notes when he refers to the “dark times”\nas an explanation for why he cannot treat the hobbits with customary\ncourtesy. Stopping the onslaught of Sauron is, therefore, much more\nthan merely thwarting an enemy: it is also saving an entire civilization\nfrom a slow slide into chaos."], "The Value of Fellowship": ["Fellowship is mentioned often in ", "The Lord of the\nRings,", " not merely because the group of freedom fighters\nstruggling to destroy the Ring calls itself the Fellowship of the\nRing. The Fellowship, in a sense, is the collective protagonist\nof Tolkien’s novel, a group representing all the free races and\nrealms of Middle-earth in the struggle against the evil of Mordor.\nFellowship is an important ideal for these characters, standing\nfor a sense of camaraderie that depends on mutual support, cooperation,\nand solidarity in which no single member is considered more essential\nthan any other. Even Gandalf, though the unofficial leader of the\nFellowship, does not order around or act superior to the others.\nHe is clearly far more powerful than any of the others, but still\nhe needs them, and therefore treats them all with respect—referring\neven to low-rankers like Merry and Pippin by their full honorific\nnames. There is also a mutual kindness that unites the members of\nthe Fellowship, as we see when Pippin gives Gimli his precious pipe\nsimply out of a desire to make the dwarf happy. It is this sensitivity\ntoward others that the villains of the novel—all of them egomaniacs—noticeably\nlack."], "Duty": ["When Aragorn and his group finally reach Isengard and\npenetrate Saruman’s stronghold of Orthanc, they are surprised to\nfind Merry and Pippin casually lying by the gates, smoking and chatting.\nFrom this memorable scene, we get an impression of the hobbits as\neasygoing and fun-loving creatures who do not thrive on the hardship and\nstruggle that the mission of Ring-bearing entails. They would clearly\nprefer to be sitting on a hillside, quietly passing the time.", "But this does not make the hobbits appear inferior to\nthe task assigned them, nor does it diminish our respect for them\nin the novel. On the contrary, it heightens our respect, as it reminds\nus how deeply they have resisted their natural tendencies in taking\non the weighty mission entrusted to them. Sometimes Frodo needs\nto pause in the journey—as on the endless steps of Cirith Ungol—but\nonly because he is exhausted, never because he simply wishes to\ndawdle. His urgent desire to reach his goal becomes stronger as\nhe nears the destination. When Gollum tells Frodo there is no way\ninto Mordor, Frodo insists bluntly that he must enter the kingdom,\nand his intensity is impressive. However easygoing the hobbits may\nbe naturally, the quest to return the Ring brings out a self-disciplined\nand unwavering determination in them, and we never once see them\nquestion the necessity of fulfilling their duty."]}}, "quotes": {"link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/twotowers/quotes/", "important_quotations_explained": {"Pippin\nlooked behind. The number of the Ents had grown—or what was happening?\nWhere the dim bare slopes that they had crossed should lie, he thought\nhe saw groves of trees. But they were moving! Could it be that the\ntrees of Fangorn were awake, and the forest was rising, marching over\nthe hills to war? ": ["The march of the army of treelike Ents\nat the end of Book III, Chapter ", "4,", " indicates\nthe universality of the War of the Ring in the context of the entire\nrealm of Middle-earth. The struggle for the Ring is not a mere squabble\nbetween greedy parties who yearn for a magic object to enhance their\npersonal power. Nor is the Ring an ancient heirloom fought over\nin some otherworldly realm that has little to do with the more immediate\nworld of Men. Rather, the struggle for the Ring involves the whole\ncosmos, the entire scale of creation from top to bottom. Even the\ntrees, which normally sleep through the various disturbances and\nconflicts of Men, as Fangorn tells us, cannot remain uninvolved\nin this battle. Their march to war here symbolizes not just another\nparty joining the action, but rather the involvement of all creation\nin the struggle against evil.", "Pippin’s amazement at the spectacle of the moving trees\nis also our amazement, as the hobbit reflects our reaction to the\nextraordinary events of Middle-earth. Unlike other fantasy novels\nin which the characters are accustomed to the events that occur\nin their world—however bizarre they may seem to us as readers—Pippin\nis just as flabbergasted as we are. Tolkien emphasizes the psychology of\nthe scene by allowing us to read Pippin’s thoughts as they appear in\nhis mind. “Or what was happening?” and “Could it be that . . . ?” are\nnot the authoritative statements of the narrator, but private questions\nthat Pippin is asking himself. This inward, psychological focus\nhelps us keep a more personal perspective on the surreal and epic\nevents unfolding in the novel."], "“[Y]ou\nare our captain and our banner. The Dark Lord has Nine. But we have\nOne, mightier than they: the White Rider. He has passed through\nthe fire and the abyss, and they shall fear him. We will go where\nhe leads.” ": ["Aragorn pays this homage to Gandalf\nin Book III, Chapter 5, revealing much about\nwhat leadership and warfare mean in this novel. The struggle between\ngood and evil is clearly no conventional military encounter, as\nAragorn makes no mention of the number of troops on the field, their\nweaponry, or their deployment in battle lines. The fact that the\nEnemy has eight more military commanders than his own army does\nnot trouble Aragorn in the slightest. The traditional concerns of\nwarriors appear to be of no interest to him. The war between the\nWest and Sauron is a higher sort of struggle, requiring spiritual\nrather than material forces. It is a highly symbolic war, which\nexplains why Aragorn calls the West’s effective leader, Gandalf,\nnot just a captain but a “banner” as well. It is\nunusual for a single person to be described as a banner, as banners\nadvertise the abstract emblems or causes for which an army or other\ngroup is fighting. But, in fact, Gandalf is his own emblem, as he\nis fighting for good and is himself a powerful symbol of good.", "The quotation also reveals much about what inspires trust\nin Gandalf’s followers. There is no mention of the wizard’s military skill\nor brilliance at tactical maneuvers. What seems to inspire Aragorn\nthe most is that Gandalf “has passed through the fire and the abyss.”\nIn this regard, personal suffering defines a great leader. Gandalf’s\nfire-tempered resolve and will are what will terrify his enemies,\nsays Aragorn—not the wizard’s talents at warfare. This characterization\nis a psychological benchmark by which to judge a good commander,\nbut it is precisely the point of the entire novel, which values\nspiritual ideals of goodness and fellowship over outward accomplishments.\nTolkien’s tale emphasizes that one’s inner life and personality\ndetermine one’s success far more than external achievements—or,\nrather, they make those achievements possible. The highly developed\ninner spirit that Gandalf displays is enough to command the servitude\nof even a great leader such as Aragorn."], "“I\ndid not give you leave to go,” said Gandalf sternly. “I have not\nfinished. You have become a fool, Saruman, and yet pitiable. You\nmight still have turned away from folly and evil, and have been\nof service. But you choose to stay and gnaw\nthe ends of your own plots.” ": ["Gandalf’s fierce rebuke of Saruman in\nBook III, Chapter 10, shows us the relationship\nbetween the good wizard and his former superior, now his enemy.\nGandalf speaks “sternly” to Saruman, as a parent might speak to\na disobedient child, telling the corrupt wizard that he does not\nhave permission to leave until the lecture is over. Adults of similar\nrank do not speak to each other in this condescending manner, even\nwhen they are angry. Rather, Gandalf’s is the tone taken by one\nwho clearly feels superior to the person he is addressing. Indeed,\nGandalf does feel superior to Saruman, and he is not ashamed to\nsay as much. Gandalf’s superiority is not based on power or prestige;\nafter all, Saruman was the leader of Gandalf’s order, and Gandalf\naddresses even those below him with extreme respect. Instead, Gandalf’s\nsense of superiority stems from the incorrect moral choices Saruman\nhas made, which have cost him considerable respect. Gandalf’s association\nof “folly” with evil reflects this lack of esteem, as if only fools\nplay at being wicked.", "Tolkien implies here that evil is something chosen, rather\nthan a cosmic force that sweeps innocent people up and corrupts\nthem. Gandalf stresses that, until recently, it was still possible\nfor Saruman to repent his ways: “You might still have turned away\nfrom folly and evil. . . .” Saruman might have, but he did not:\nhe made a choice, and it was the wrong one. After that, Gandalf\nagain emphasizes, “[Y]ou choose to stay.” Such a conception of morality\nas free choice is important in Tolkien’s universe. As grand and\ndramatic as the tale of ", "The Lord of the Rings", " is,\nits definition of good and evil is very traditional. Every being,\nfrom the humblest Dwarf to the mightiest Wizard, chooses a course\nof action in life and then accepts the consequences."], "“Yess,\nwretched we are, precious,” [Gollum] whined. “Misery misery! Hobbits\nwon’t kill us, nice hobbits.” “No, we won’t,”\nsaid Frodo. “But we won’t let you go, either. You’re full of wickedness\nand mischief. . . .” ": ["This dialogue between Frodo and Gollum,\nwhen the hobbits first encounter the creature and tame him in Book\nIV, Chapter 1, gives us a clear picture of\nFrodo’s characteristic frankness. The hobbits do not owe Gollum\nany explanations about why they are forced to keep him captive.\nOther creatures, such as Orcs, kidnap the hobbits without giving\nthem the slightest indication of why they are being captured or\nwhere they will be taken, as with Merry and Pippin’s capture in\nBook III. Frodo, however, is an honorable character, and he insists\non being straightforward with Gollum about his impressions of the\ncreature’s wickedness and mischief. Frodo is neither silent nor\nevasive, but upfront and honest. Moreover, he never creates the\nimpression of being intoxicated with his own power. His casual way\nof saying “But we won’t let you go, either” displays none of the\ngrandiose posturing that Saruman, for instance, would show if he\nhad the opportunity to inform someone of his captivity. For Frodo,\npower is just a fact, not a justification for complacency or bullying.", "This passage also showcases Gollum’s sneaky and deceptive\npersonality, which distinguishes him from the other evil characters\nin the novel, who, for the most part, are just what they appear\nto be. Gollum’s self-abasing remarks, such as “wretched we are,”\nalong with his incessant whining, are not imaginable in other evil\ncharacters, such as Saruman. Gollum whines and puts himself down\nin order to play on the hobbits’ sympathy—a tactic that works better on\nthe trusting Frodo than on the skeptical Sam. Frodo’s goodwill is his\nweak point, as we find out later, when Gollum ultimately betrays the\nhobbits. Indeed, this tiny conversation between Frodo and Gollum\nis an ironic foreshadowing of the creature’s final treachery in Shelob’s\nlair. Here, Frodo tells Gollum that he is “full of wickedness,”\nand we realize later how tragically true this assertion is."], "“[T]he\nold wisdom and beauty brought out of the West remained long in the\nrealm of the sons of Elendil the Fair, and they linger there still.\nYet even so it was Gondor that brought about its own decay, falling\nby degrees into dotage, and thinking that the Enemy was asleep,\nwho was only banished not destroyed.” ": ["Faramir recounts the history of the\nfall of Gondor to Frodo and Sam in Book IV, Chapter 5.\nFaramir’s words remind us of the constant sense throughout the novel\nthat the world of Middle-earth is changing. Nearly all the characters\nthe hobbits encounter on their wanderings remark that they cannot\nafford to be as hospitable to strangers as they used to be—they\nare living in “dark times,” as Éomer puts it. The world is a more\nconfusing place than it was before, and visitors are not always\nwho they seem. The old ways and traditions do not apply as they\nused to, for a new world order is emerging. This change is not always\nfor the better, as the history of Gondor illustrates. The ancient\nLords of Gondor were once proud and free, but the entire realm now\nlives in fear of Sauron. Gondor was once a blossoming land of orchards\nand gardens, but is now barren and deteriorating. The reality of\ndecay is symbolized in the headless and graffiti-covered statue\nof an early king of Gondor that Frodo and Sam come upon in their\ntravels.", "The causes for these changes in the world of Middle-earth\nare not concerns of economics or politics, which we never hear about\nin the course of the novel. We do not see or hear of merchants’\ndisputes or groups clamoring for recognition by states or governments.\nIndeed, economics and politics are almost entirely absent from Tolkien’s worldview.\nThe main motivating force behind world history in ", "The Lord\nof the Rings ", "is morality and the strength that supports\nit. The “wisdom and beauty” of which Faramir speaks here are really shorthand\nterms for moral good and strength of character. The fall of Gondor\nwas caused by rulers who took the morality of their kingdom for\ngranted, forgetting that it needed to be defended against evil,\nas the Fellowship is now trying to do. The clash between good and\nevil keeps history moving, and keeps the world in constant flux as\nthe balance between the two opposing forces changes over time."]}}}

The notion that a single person could\npossibly embody a teeming, diverse, multitudinous nation like India\nencapsulates one of the novel’s fundamental concerns: the tension\nbetween the single and the many. The dynamic relationship between\nSaleem’s individual life and the collective life of the nation suggests\nthat public and private will always influence one another, but it\nremains unclear whether they can be completely equated with one\nanother. Throughout the novel, Saleem struggles to contain all of\nIndia within himself—to cram his personal story with the themes\nand stories of his country—only to disintegrate and collapse at\nthe end of his attempt.", "Politically speaking, the tension between the single and\nthe many also marks the nation of India itself. One of the fastest\ngrowing nations in the world, India has always been an incredibly\ndiverse. Its constitution recognizes twenty-two official languages,\nand the population practices religions as varied as Hinduism, Islam,\nChristianity, Sikhism, and Buddhism, among many others. Indian culture\nis similarly hybrid, having been influenced by countless other cultures over\nthe millennia of its development. At the same time, however, maintaining\nIndia’s sprawling diversity in a peaceful fashion has often proved\ndifficult: India’s division into the Islamic nation of Pakistan\nand the secular, but mostly Hindu nation of India—a process known\nas Partition—remains the most striking example of the desire to\ncontain and reduce India’s plurality.

His\npowers of telepathy allow him to transcend the barriers of language,\nwhile he himself—with his English blood, poor background, wealthy\nupbringing, and eclectic religious influeces—reflects India’s diversity\nand range.

He willfully acknowledges that\nhe misplaced Gandhi’s death, an obviously seminal moment in India’s\nhistory, as well as willfully misremembers the date of an election.\nHe frets over the accuracy of his story and worries about future\nerrors he might make. Yet, at the same time, after acknowledging\nhis error, Saleem decides to maintain his version of events, since\nthat’s how they appeared to occur to him and now there can be no\ngoing back. Despite its potential historical inaccuracies, Saleem\nsees his story as being of equal importance as the world’s most\nimportant religious texts. This is not only his story but also the\nstory of India. The errors in his story, in addition to casting\na shadow of doubt over some of what he claims, point to one of the\nnovel’s essential claims: that truth is not just a matter of verifiable\nfacts. Genuine historical truth depends on perspective—and a willingness\nto believe. Saleem notes that memory creates its own truth, and\nso do narratives. Religious texts and history books alike stake\ntheir claim in truth not only because they are supported by facts\nbut also because they have been codified and accepted upon, whether\nby time or faith. The version of history Saleem offers comes filtered\nthrough his perspective, just as every other version of history\ncomes filtered through some alternate perspective. For Saleem, his\nversion is as true as anything else that could be written, not just\nbecause this is the way he has arranged it, but because this is\nthe version he believes.

The enmity and tension between the two begin at the\nmoment of their simultaneous births.

Saleem, as the narrator of ", "Midnight’s Children", ",\nis responsible for creating the world we, as readers, are engaged\nin. He represents Brahma, the god of creation. What Saleem creates,\nhowever, is not life, but a story.

Throughout his story,\nSaleem has appeared anxious about his historical inconsistencies.\nHe is also acutely aware of how fantastic and far-fetched his narrative\nsounds to the skeptical, pragmatic Padma. After he emerges from\nhis fever-induced dream, it becomes especially important for Saleem\nto assert the veracity of his story. For Saleem, everything he says\nis true—not necessarily because it happened that way, but because\nhe remembers it that way. An event from a person’s past gains meaning\nfor that person’s present existence only when it becomes filtered\nthrough memory and becomes part of the overall story of that person’s\nlife. Only then can connections be made and conclusions drawn, and\nevents and instances accrue significance. Saleem has rearranged\nhistory not only because he has forgotten the proper order of events,\nbut also because by doing so his story gains greater depth and meaning.\nSaleem’s rearrangement of facts serves a greater truth as he creates\na new pattern through which to interpret both his own history and that\nof India itself."], "2.\tI have been only the humblest\nof jugglers-with-facts; and that, in a country where the truth is\nwhat it is instructed to be, reality quite literally ceases to exist,\nso that everything becomes possible except what we are told is the\ncase. ": ["This quotation occurs in Book Two, at\nthe end of the chapter titled “Jamila Singer.” Reflecting on his\ntime in Pakistan, Saleem makes an explicit argument against the\nstrict political control and religious dogmatism of the Pakistani\ngovernment. In a nation defined by one official perspective, with\na government that violently rejects any threat to its singularity,\nreality cannot exist, since reality is inherently composed of multiple\nperspectives. Reality is not just composed of a single truth, as\nthe repressive rulers of Pakistan would have the people believe.\nLies become necessary to live in a place like Pakistan, in order\nto maintain the fiction of singularity. Saleem argues that although\nhis narrative may play fast and loose with historical facts, his\nstory is still more truthful and authentic than the Pakistani government’s,\nbecause his tale celebrates and welcomes plurality, a multiplicity\nof perspectives, and the possibility of contradiction."], "3.\tLet me state this quite unequivocally:\nit is my firm conviction that the hidden purpose of the Indo-Pakistani war\nof 1965 was nothing more nor less than the elimination of my benighted\nfamily from the face of the earth. ": ["This quotation occurs in Book Two, in\nthe chapter “How Saleem Achieved Purity.” Throughout the telling\nof his story, Saleem often places himself at the center of major\npolitical events. While we can detect a strain of narcissism in\nSaleem’s desire to see himself as either the central cause or primary\nvictim of various historical events, his life does converge with\nnational history on countless occasions. If we consider that Saleem—born\nat the dawn of India’s independence, and destined to break into\nas many pieces as India has citizens—represents the entire population\nof India, it makes sense that his life seems directly impacted by\nnational events. Things that happen on a national or global scale\nwill always affect the collective life of a nation’s people.", "By claiming that the purpose of the Indo-Pakistani war\nwas to eliminate his family, Saleem draws critical attention to\nthe fact that the war was justified in religious terms. The Indian\npresence in Kashmir was represented as a kind of defilement, and\nthe Pakistani government claimed that Pakistan needed to reclaim\nKashmir for the good of the country. Saleem claims that he and his\ngrotesque family also needed to be cleansed in order for the nation\nto be purified. The absurdity of Saleem’s claim that an entire war\nmight be fought in order to murder a family of civilians highlights\nthe absurdity of Pakistan’s claim. "], "4.\tWho what am I? My answer: I am\nthe sum total of everything that went before me, of all I have been\nseen done, , of everything done-to-me. ": ["This quotation appears in Book Three,\nat the end of the chapter “Sam and the Tiger.” Saleem has just finished\nrecalling the rage he felt upon realizing the fundamental unfairness\nof life. This passage is a perfect expression of Saleem’s narrative.\nHe begins his life story thirty-two years before his birth, and\nfrom that moment, considers everything that has happened as being\nsomehow related to his life. There is a connection between past\nand present, between the state and the individual. History is never\npast. It plays an active role in shaping the present, and Saleem’s\nstory is an attempt to capture that dynamic relationship. "], "5.\tFutility of statistics: during\n1971, ten million refugees fled across the borders of East Pakistan-Bangladesh\ninto India—but ten million (like all numbers larger than one thousand and\none) refuses to be understood. ": ["This quotation appears in Book Three,\nin the chapter “The Buddha.” Saleem, now in the service of the Pakistani\nArmy, finds himself aiding the violent repression of the Bangladeshi\nindependence movement. In a novel already riddled with violence\nand massive causalities, this is a blunt acknowledgement of the\nfact that there is no way to express the scale of violence and suffering\nthat is occurring. Even Saleem’s first hand account of the atrocities\nhe witnesses becomes suffused with a sense that what he sees is\nincomprehensible. The human mind cannot grasp tragedies of this\nscale, and we require a microcosmic representation of the victims—midnight’s children—to\nattach individual identities to historical realities. One thousand\nand one is the largest number that can be understood, according\nto Saleem, and so rather than try and represent the loss of hope\nfor an entire generation, Rushdie has him offer us the representative\ndestruction of these children.

This range is largely due\nto the location and audience of the different authors of the New Testament.\nMatthew’s Gospel was written for a largely Jewish group to convince\nthem that Jesus was the hoped-for Messiah, and so he interprets\nJesus as someone who relives the experience of Israel. For Matthew,\neverything about Jesus is prophesied in the Old Testament. The Old\nTestament narratives to which Matthew refers served as ways in which\nearly followers of Jesus could make sense out of his birth, death,\nand resurrection.

Paul contrasts Christianity’s emphasis on the grace\nof God and the faith of the believer with the Jewish insistence on\nthe law as the necessary means for salvation. Paul’s theology inaugurates\na strong anti-Jewish tradition in Christianity, which claims that\nChristianity is a higher, more spiritual tradition than Judaism.\nThis claim is called Christian supercessionism because it is based\non the idea that the New Testament supercedes the Old Testament.\nSupercessionists believe that the laws laid down in the Old Testament\nare external, in the sense that they regulate human behaviors rather\nthan spiritual states, and that these laws become unnecessary through\nChrist. Supercessionism simplifies the rich and subtle theology\nof the Old Testament, which makes no such distinction between faith\nand works."], "Salvation for Social Outcasts ": ["Some scholars have argued that the New Testament’s references\nto sinners actually referred to those who were marginalized, poor,\ncast out, orphaned, diseased, or widowed. Jesus not only promises\nsalvation to such sinners, but goes so far as to call their poverty\nitself “blessed” throughout the Gospels. At many points in Jesus’s\nministry, he shocks mainstream Jews by associating with, ministering\nto, and healing people who are cast out, poor, and sick. Some have argued\nthat a prominent theme in the Gospels is Jesus’s good news to such\npeople and an invitation to the rich to join them."], "Salvation Through Faith in Christ": ["In his final letter to the new churches in Romans, Paul\nsummarizes his lifelong question about the relationship between\nJewish law, which requires certain observances and actions, and\nfaith in the grace offered by God through Jesus Christ, which is\ngiven freely and without regard for good works. This issue was particularly\nproblematic in Rome because the early church consisted both of Jewish followers\nof Christ, who observed the law, and Gentile followers, to whom\nthe law was relatively unknown. Paul concludes that the law is a gift\nfrom God, and can help people become more faithful, but ultimately\nwe are justified by faith alone, and the grace of God is available to\nboth Jews and Gentiles.

A world without Logos,\nthe Greeks believed, would be chaos.

Jesus is the Word, the Logos, who is the instrument\nof total victory of light over darkness, its binary opposite: “What\nhas come into being in him was life.

In Mark’s version of the parable (Mark ", "4:14", "–", "20", "),\nJesus interprets the parable for his inner circle of followers,\nthough most scholars conclude that such interpretations were later\nadditions by the early church.

The novel describes the increasingly vicious War of Five Kings in Westeros, Daenerys’s strengthening forces in the East, and the oncoming threat of the Others, a ghostly army that is nearly invincible. The story is told from the perspective of 12 different characters, though 10 tell the majority of the story.

At the end of the previous novel, he was involved in a massive battle in which he showed great courage and was seriously wounded. As he recovers, he tries to win the favor he feels his family owes him, but to little effect. His father, Tywin, continues to disparage him, and his sister, Cersei, despises him as much as ever. Tyrion does little to hide his disapproval of his family and the reign of King Joffrey, his nephew. Meanwhile, Tyrion has been carrying on a secret relationship with Shae, a prostitute he has disguised as a castle maid. The relationship becomes complicated when Tyrion, for political reasons and much against his will, is married to 13-year-old Sansa Stark. Tyrion refuses to consummate the marriage with the terrified young Sansa, who for some time has been a hostage to the Lannisters and subjected to endless mistreatment.", "\n", "During this time, King Joffrey has been engaged to marry Margaery Tyrell in order to create an alliance between their two houses.

As he waits in jail, Shae quickly forgets him. Then, just before his execution, his recently returned brother, Jaime, rescues him. Jaime admits to having lied to Tyrion in the past about a woman that Tyrion once married, but who Tywin in disapproval had his soldiers rape to drive her off. Jaime told Tyrion at the time she was a prostitute he had paid to sleep with Tyrion, but he now reveals to Tyrion that she was just a crofter’s daughter and her marriage to Tyrion wasn’t purchased.

He strangles her first, then discovering his father in the bathroom, kills him with a crossbow.", "\n", "Sansa is also suspected of having been involved in Joffrey's murder. In fact, she had been planning to escape with the help of a knight whom she had once saved from Joffrey's wrath. On the night of Joffrey's wedding, immediately after Joffrey is killed, the knight takes her out to a waiting ship. Sansa is shocked to find on board the devious and charismatic Petyr Baelish, who reveals that the poison was smuggled into the wedding feast in Sansa’s hairnet. They escape to the castle Baelish shares with his wife, Lysa, who is also Sansa's aunt. There, Sansa is betrothed to the sickly young Robert, her own cousin. One day, as Sansa builds a snow castle during a snowstorm, Baelish tries to kiss her. Lysa becomes suspicious, and when she angrily confronts Baelish, he murders her.

Arya runs away from the group, but the Hound finds and kidnaps her, taking her with him. They travel to a fortress called the Twins, where Arya’s brother Robb will be married, but they arrive just as assassins kill Robb and slaughter his court. The Hound takes Arya to an inn.

Melisandre anticipates Davos's move and imprisons him. Rather than execute him, however, Stannis, with Melisandre's approval, makes Davos his “Hand,” or most trusted advisor. Davos remains skeptical of Melisandre, and when he learns that Edric Storm will be sacrificed to the god R’hllor at Melisandre’s bidding, Davos helps Edric escape. He then convinces King Stannis to help the Night’s Watch repel the northern invasion.", "\n", "Because she released Ser Jaime Lannister, her family's sworn enemy, without the permission of her son Robb, the King in the North, Lady Catelyn Stark is accused of treason. She freed Jaime with the understanding that he would return her daughters, Sansa and Arya, to her, so Robb forgives her. He also reveals that he married Jeyne Westerling, despite having promised to marry one of Lord Walder Frey's daughters in order to solidify an alliance between their families. Everyone knows it was a disastrous lapse in judgment. Robb tries to mend ties by marrying Catelyn’s brother, Edmure, to Roslin, a Frey daughter. At Edmure’s wedding, however, Frey assassins massacre the Stark court, including Robb and Catelyn, in what is infamously called the Red Wedding. Three days after her death, Catelyn reappears, horribly scarred, unable to speak, and seething for vengeance.", "\n", "Ser Jaime Lannister, meanwhile, is on his way back to King's Landing after being released by Catelyn Stark. He is not entirely free; he is shackled and escorted by Brienne of Tarth, a tough and extremely dutiful woman who promised to see Jaime safely home and bring Catelyn's daughters back to her. Jaime and Brienne come to respect one another despite being adversaries. Eventually Brienne and Jaime are recognized and abducted on the road, and one of the captors cuts off Jaime's sword hand. It is a tremendous blow to Jaime, who has shaped his whole life and identity around being a skilled swordfighter and knight. They are taken to the court of Lord Bolton, who releases Jaime to win favor with the Lannisters. As Jaime is leaving, he sees Brienne fighting unarmed against a bear for the amusement of her captors and rescues her. When Jaime returns to the House of Lannister, he is restored to the Kingsguard and has a dramatic change of heart about himself.

At the end of the previous novel, Jon and his commander were captured by the wildlings, and Jon was instructed to feign joining them to gather information. Jon becomes close with Mance Rayder, a former brother of the Night’s Watch and leader of the wildlings. He learns that a horde of undead creatures called the Others has begun moving south, which is why the wildlings are heading toward The Wall. He also starts a relationship with Ygritte, a wildling woman, and falls in love with her. Eventually Jon escapes, and upon making it back to The Wall, reveals the wildlings’ intention to invade. When the invasion comes, Jon bravely helps lead the defense, but a faction of the Watch with a personal grudge against him accuses him of being a traitor and imprisons him. He is told he can only prove his loyalty by killing Mance Rayder, which is essentially a suicide mission. While the wildlings continue to siege The Wall, King Stannis arrives with his forces and drives the wildlings off. Stannis has Jon freed and offers to make him the Lord of Winterfell, a title Jon could never have held because he was a bastard.

He and a small number of men survive the battle, and they go to Craster’s Keep. While there, a mutiny breaks out and some men kill the Watch's Lord Commander, Mormont.

Ultimately they arrive at The Wall and meet the mysterious Coldhands, who takes them through it via the ancient Black Gate.", "\n", "In the east, Daenerys Tagaryen needs to raise an army to invade Westeros and reclaim her crown. Ser Jorah Mormont, her guardian and advisor, tells her she can buy a slave army in Slaver's Bay, a region where slavery is common that includes the cities of Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen. In Astapor, at Ser Jorah's behest, she purchases a massive troupe of Unsullied, eunuch slave warriors who are skilled and fearless fighters, though she is horrified by the way they are raised and trained. Immediately after buying them, she turns them against their former masters and has all the slaves in the city set free.

Whitebeard is actually Ser Baristan Selmy, a former knight of the Kingsguard who sought out Daenerys as the rightful ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. He didn't reveal himself because before pledging himself to her he first wanted to make sure she wasn't mad, like some of her ancestors had been. Ser Jorah, on the other hand, had been selling information on her to spies from Westeros, though he stopped some time ago. Daenerys offers them a chance to redeem themselves by sneaking into Meereen through the sewers and opening the doors. They succeed and Daenerys's army takes the city. She forgives Ser Barristan, but Ser Jorah's betrayful is too painful and she banishes him.

Family allegiance, therefore, is of vital importance, and different families that share close ties often function like a single, extended clan. The various families of the North, for example, generally act as a united front against the major families of the South, despite whatever personal struggles may be occurring between them. These family alliances have a great deal of power, and so social contracts like marriage that formally join families together become critically important in the politics of Westeros. King Joffrey's betrothals illustrate this point. He was initially engaged to marry Sansa Stark as a way to unite their families, but when it became clear that the union afforded no political advantage, Joffrey was quickly engaged to Margaery Tyrell instead. When these same social ties are broken, the results can be what is fundamentally clan warfare. Robb Stark's decision to marry Jeyne Westerling rather than a woman from the Frey family, as he promised, provoked the Freys into a massacre of the Starks and their allies at the Red Wedding."], "Breaking the Conventional Female Mold": ["The world we see in the novel is mostly male dominated. Male monarchs rule the lands, male advisors counsel them, male knights fight their wars, and women are married off in order to secure lands and titles. Male characters constantly threaten women with abuse, and many women are treated as property or sexual objects. (Notably, this rubric is consistent with European gender dynamics during the Middle Ages.) But the novel’s major female characters generally defy these conventional roles. Daenerys, for instance, is a strong-willed leader. Cersei wields significant power in King's Landing and is at times the de facto ruler of Westeros. But no characters chafe against conventional female roles as Arya and Brienne do. From the first, Arya has been more interested in swordfighting than needle work, which is why naming her sword ", "Needle", " was loaded with irony, and she bristles when anyone suggests that she should behave a certain way because she's a girl. Brienne similarly eschews feminine trappings and refuses to be dominated by any man. She may also be the only female knight in existence, and despite the verbal and sometimes physical abuse she suffers for her dress and behavior, she continues to behave as she wants, not as others think she should.", "There are instances where major female characters play traditional female roles, but even in those instances they turn these roles to their advantage. Cersei, notably, feels she must fulfill a conventional female role, even as laments at times that she wasn't born a man. She thinks she must always be beautiful, and she doesn't think she would ever be able to rule Westeros openly. But she also uses men's perceptions of her as a sex object to her advantage, often manipulating them into doing what she wants in exchange for sexual favors, or even just the hope of them. Catelyn Stark hews to a conventional female role as well, albeit in a much different way. She is a typical mother figure, and much of what she does in the novel she does in order to take care of her children, particularly Robb. That need to protect her children is the source of a great deal of her strength."], "The Need for Revenge": ["As the war progresses, the royal houses keep track of crimes and betrayals, and for each perceived misdeed, a character often seeks revenge. The need for revenge is so prevalent in the novel that it motivates a great deal of the novel's plot and serves as a driving force for several characters. It also leads to the deaths of numerous characters. In some instances, revenge is sought for relatively minor infractions like an insult to a character's or family's honor. When Robb breaks his engagement to a Frey daughter, for instance, the Freys get their revenge by assassinating Robb and Catelyn Stark at the Red Wedding. In other instances it stems from long-standing grievances, as when Tyrion vows vengeance against Jaime and then murders his father in revenge for their mistreatment of him and Tysha, the woman he once loved.", "In many other cases, characters seek retribution for the murder of their friends or family members. A reanimated Catelyn Stark joins the Brotherhood Without Banners to exact revenge on the Freys for their massacre of her family at the Red Wedding. Arya lives obsessed with gaining vengeance on those who have hurt or killed her family and friends, and she regularly recites a list of names to herself of those people so she won't forget them. Tyrion's champion at his trial, Oberyn Martell, takes up the role so that he can get revenge against Gregor Clegane, the other combatant, for violence Gregor committed against Martell's family in the past. Occasionally in these situations, the revenge exacted by one character causes another character to want retribution, perpetuating the need for revenge."], "The Struggles of Identity": ["Several characters endure struggles with their identities in the novel, as events force them to reconsider how they think of themselves and what person they want to be. Jon Snow faces two such struggles. First, as he pretends to be a wildling, he finds himself fitting in among the wildlings more than he anticipated, and he even breaks his vows to the Night's Watch by getting involved in a romantic relationship with Ygritte. Ultimately he must decide whether he wants to become one of them or return to the Watch, and he struggles a great deal with the decision. Later, he is offered the chance to rule over Winterfell by Stannis but would have to leave the Watch to do so. This situation taps directly into the identity issues Jon had growing up, when he felt himself not fully a part of the Stark family, and he feels torn again between what are essentially two versions of himself."], "The Importance of Honor": ["Honor is a major motivating force in the book and serves as one of the major ways in which characters are defined. Often the notion of honor is about preserving one's esteem in the eyes of others just as much as it's about doing what's morally correct. The Freys took Robb Stark's engagement to Jeyne Westerling, after he promised to marry a Frey girl, as an affront to their honor, because it suggested that he held the Freys in low regard and didn't value them. That slight to their honor prompted the Freys to murder Robb, Catelyn, and the Stark bannermen at the Red Wedding. As Merrett Frey explains just before he’s hanged in the book’s epilogue, the Freys did it because they “had to cleanse the stain on [their] honor.” Similarly, earlier in the book, when Robb decides he has no choice but to execute Rickard Karstark for killing the two Lannister allies they were holding prisoner, it's both because Karstark's act was reprehensible—the two he killed were unarmed boys—and because Karstark was publicly disregarding Robb's authority by acting on his own. As Robb puts it, “Karstark killed more than a Frey and a Lannister. ", "He killed my honor", ".” Robb chooses to execute Karstark, a valuable ally and friend, because he deems his honor more important than Karstark.", "Often honor goes hand-in-hand with upholding one’s vows, which is why Jaime is considered among the most dishonorable figures in Westeros. He took an oath to protect King Aerys when he was first made a member of the Kingsguard, and he broke his vow by murdering Aerys. The title of ", "Kingslayer", " serves as a testament to that lack of honor. The character transformation he undergoes over the course of the novel centers on him realizing honor’s value and then trying to restore his honor. Brienne of Tarth has suffered a similar dishonor in that she is widely suspected to have either killed Renly or conspired in his murder while part of his guard. Jaime gives the sword Oathkeeper to Brienne and sends her to save Sansa as a way for both to regain some measure of honor, since both promised Catelyn they would find and save Sansa. (Jaime literally says to Brienne, “Sansa Stark is my last chance for honor.”) Brienne, in fact, is primarily motivated by honor. That’s why she escorts Jaime back to King’s Landing, despite her dislike for Jaime and at great risk to herself. She promised Catelyn she would, and so she does, whatever her personal feelings. Jon Snow is also motivated by honor to a large degree. A significant factor in his returning to the Watch after living with the wildlings, and then choosing the Watch over Winterfell, is that he made a vow. Honor demands that he stick to that vow, so he puts aside his personal feelings to uphold it."]}}, "quotes": {"link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/a-storm-of-swords/quotes/", "important_quotations_explained": {"1. “It all goes back and back, Tyrion thought, to our mothers and fathers and theirs before them. We are puppets dancing on the strings of those who came before us, and one day our own children will take up our strings and dance on in our steads.” ": ["Tyrion has this thought as he faces charges for poisoning King Joffrey. Already jaded, Tyrion has become supremely cynical, because he knows he has not committed the crime, yet several witnesses have testified against him. When Oberyn visits him, he recounts that Tyrion’s father once offered him to Elia, Oberyn’s sister. Because Tyrion was ugly and a dwarf, the proposal insulted Oberyn’s family. Tyrion never knew this, and he realizes that his family has controlled every aspect of his life to some degree. The quote suggests that everyone in Westeros is subject to this same manipulation. Sometimes family grievances going back generations serve as the reason for families that have no reason to fight today. Family honor and tradition dictate what a child may or may not be, and who that person may marry. Though Tyrion doesn’t mention Tysha, the example is pertinent. Tyrion wasn’t allowed to marry her because of his family, because his was too high and hers too low. Tyrion feels that he is only a pawn in a larger game, which is explicitly described as the “game of thrones.”", "It is interesting to note that Tyrion has no children, and he never expresses any interest in having children. He squanders his sexuality on prostitutes, and he refuses to consummate his marriage with Sansa, though technically he is within his rights to do so even if she doesn’t consent. Though it is never explicitly stated, having children is not a priority for Tyrion, perhaps because he fears how those children will look, and perhaps because he does not wish to continue the game. Whatever his unspoken hesitations, Tyrion has reached a dead end and cannot continue this way of life, even if his execution is stayed. This epiphany informs Tyrion’s choice to estrange Jaime and Cersei and murder his own father in his bedchamber. By rejecting his family, Tyrion becomes independent for the first time. Contrary to the quote, Tyrion effectively snips the strings that make him dance."], "2. “A dragon is no slave.” ": ["Daenerys declares this to the slave master Kraznys mo Nakloz, just before she kills him. In the scene, Daenerys “sells” one of her dragons to Kraznys in exchange for an army of Unsullied slave warriors. Dragons are weapons of great power in the novel. Some people, like Kraznys mo Nakloz, seem to think of a dragon as something like a mindless tool that can be wielded like a sword. But Daenerys recognizes that they are dangerous and have their own wills. Her quote suggests it would be both cruel to enslave them, which is not surprising as she considers her dragons to be her children and loves them deeply, and essentially impossible, since they’re too powerful to be held by any man. Moreover, dragons have a connotation of being regal creatures because of their power and rarity. What Daenerys also implies is that it would be wrong to debase something so noble. It’s in that sense that Daenerys also refers to herself with these words. The Targaryen family is closely tied to dragons, as dragons have long been the source of the family’s power and prestige. In fact, the Targaryens are often referred to figuratively as dragons, and so what Daenerys additionally suggests is that she won’t be subservient by handing over one of her dragons to someone like Kraznys."], "3. “Fear cuts deeper than swords.” ": ["Arya utters this phrase to herself numerous times in the novel, usually during moments of high tension or violence. The mantra came from her Braavosi sword master, and it reminds her that fear can be a greater danger than whatever physical threat she faces. In other words, if she can remain calm and keep her head, she can make the smart decisions that will allow her to stay alive. If she gives in to her fear and panics, however, it could mean her life. Maintaining control of her emotions is particularly important for Arya since physically she is often overpowered. She is still young and quite small, so she’s no match for many of the enemies she faces. Controlling her emotions gives her the closest thing to an advantage she has. That she has to say these words to herself makes clear that she does, in fact, still feel afraid. Though Arya is so young, she’s killed several people by the end of ", "A Storm of Swords", ", and she often behaves like someone much older and stronger than she is. Each time she says her mantra to steel herself, it also reminds the reader that she’s a child and has to actively override her fear to do the things she does."], "4. “I am like this torch, Ser Davos. We are both instruments of R’hllor. We were made for a single purpose—to keep the darkness at bay. Do you believe that?” ": ["Melisandre says this to Davos in Davos’s cell after she’s had him arrested. Davos arrives on Dragonstone with the intent of murdering Melisandre. He blames her for the deaths of his sons in the Battle of the Blackwater that concluded the previous book, and he also worries that she has too much influence on Stannis. In this scene, Melisandre tries to convince Davos that she’s not the enemy, and the quote speaks to her entire worldview. Melisandre repeatedly insists that her purpose is to destroy the Other, a nameless evil god who opposes her own god, R’hllor. No earthly matter is more important than this divine battle between the two opposite forces of death and life, represented by the Other and R’hllor respectively. She also claims Stannis is the reincarnation of Azor Ahai and that he will save the world from darkness.", "But it’s never certain how sincere she is. More specifically, it’s unclear whether she actually believes what she says about Stannis or whether she’s just manipulating him for her own ends. It’s no small matter as she has more influence over Stannis than anyone else, and since Stannis commands a sizeable army there are thousands of lives at stake. Davos in particular suspects her, not least because in ", "A Clash of Kings", " she gives birth to some sort of supernatural shadow in his presence. Since, he has both feared and despised her, and he thinks she is more likely evil than good. In response to her question of whether Davos believes what she says about her purpose, Davos states directly that he doesn’t and calls her the “mother of darkness.”"], "5. “ Can it be? They took my sword hand. Was that all I was, a sword hand? Gods be good, is it true? ” ": ["Jaime thinks these words to himself shortly after losing his hand, while Brienne convinces him to try to survive. Jaime’s loss of his hand prompts a crisis of identity in him in which he suddenly doesn’t know who he is or what value he has. From a character perspective, Jaime undergoes the most radical transformation in the book. He begins the story cruel and arrogant. He undermines and insults everyone around him, partly out of frustration, and partly because he seems to have a sadistic streak. Because of his skill with a sword he commands a great deal of respect, and a healthy measure of fear, from those around him, and living by his sword as a knight gives him a sense of purpose. But once he loses his hand, Jaime is suddenly weak and alone. He feels extraordinarily vulnerable for the first time, and he feels useless. He no longer commands respect and is called a “cripple” and derided.

Katniss returns home from the woods one day to find President Snow waiting for her. He’s concerned that any more public defiance of the Capitol by Katniss, like her and Peeta’s threat of suicide at the end of the Hunger Games, could spark an uprising in the districts. She has to continue pretending that she’s in love with Peeta, or they’ll hurt Gale, Katniss’s oldest friend. Katniss tells Haymitch everything that happened, and she realizes that she’ll never be able to stop pretending: She’ll have to marry Peeta.", "\n", "Peeta and Katniss, meanwhile, have had a tense relationship since Peeta found out that Katniss was only pretending to be in love with him during the Games. They agree to be friends, however, as they embark on their Victory Tour of the districts. Their first stop is District 11. It was the home district of Rue, the girl Katniss befriended who was ultimately killed during the Games. An old man in the crowd whistles out a signal that Katniss and Rue used, and everyone in the crowd puts up a gesture of respect used in Katniss’s home district, District 12. Before she is rushed away, Katniss sees a group of Peacekeepers execute the old man. In other districts, Katniss can sense an undercurrent of repressed rage that suggests people are ready to rebel. At the end of the tour, Peeta and Katniss plan for Peeta to propose during a televised interview to try to appease the Capitol. They do it, but President Snow indicates to Katniss that it’s not enough. Later, at a feast at President Snow’s mansion, Katniss meets Plutarch Heavensbee, the new Head Gamemaker. He shows her his watch, and when he rubs the face, a mockingjay like the one on the pin she wears appears and quickly vanishes. After she returns home, she learns there’s been an uprising in District 8.", "\n", "Katniss goes to meet Gale in the woods and tells him everything that’s happened. She wants to run away with their families, and Gale tells her he loves her. When she mentions the uprising, however, he says he wants to stay and fight. Katniss goes to tell Peeta, who agrees to run away, but then, in the town’s main square, they find Gale being publicly whipped for hunting. As Gale recuperates, Katniss realizes she loves him and decides not to run away.", "\n", "Weeks later, Katniss goes back into the woods and is shocked to meet two women. One holds out a cracker to Katniss with the image of her mockingjay in the center. They explain they’re from District 8 and fled after the uprising. They’re on their way to District 13, which was destroyed years earlier but which they believe is home to a group of underground rebels. Back at home later, Katniss watches the televised announcement about the Quarter Quell. Every twenty-five years, a special Hunger Games occur, and this year is the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Games. In the announcement, President Snow says the tributes will be selected from among the past winners of the Games. Since Katniss is the only female winner of District 12, it means she’s going back into the arena.", "\n", "Katniss, Peeta, and Haymitch begin training for the Games, and when the reaping, or tribute selection, happens, Peeta volunteers to go in place of Haymitch. They meet the other tributes, most of whom have known each other for years, which makes the Games more awful since they still have to kill each other. Katniss immediately dislikes Finnick Odair, the male tribute from District 4, and Johanna Mason, the woman from District 7. She prefers Wiress and Beetee, the smart but physically weak tributes from District 3, and Mags, the eighty-year-old woman from District 4. The tributes are interviewed on television before they depart for the arena, and President Snow makes Katniss wear a wedding dress. Cinna, Katniss’s stylist, rigs it, and during the interview, it burns away leaving Katniss in a mockingjay costume.", "\n", "Finally the tributes are sent to the arena, a small tropical island, and the Games begin. Right away Katniss comes face to face with Finnick. To her surprise, he tells her they’re allies, and she notices a bracelet on his wrist that belonged to Haymitch. Katniss, Peeta, Finnick, and Mags form a group and head into the jungle where Katniss discovers that an electrical force field blocks part of the island and creates a dome over them. A dense fog descends on them and turns out to be a toxic nerve agent. They run from it, but their limbs begin to seize up. Finnick can carry only Peeta or Mags, and so Mags sacrifices herself by running into the fog. The remaining three barely make it to the beach.", "\n", "Eventually they see Johanna Mason approaching with Wiress and Beetee. Johanna tells Katniss she saved them for her. Katniss realizes that the island is laid out like a clock face, with each section containing a different attack triggered at a set time, and she remembers Plutarch Heavensbee talking about his watch as he showed her the mockingjay. She realizes he was trying to tip her off about the arena. They all head to the Cornucopia, which contains weapons, and while they’re loading up a group of tributes sneaks up. One slits Wiress’s throat before Katniss kills him. Finnick saves Peeta in the fight.", "\n", "The group heads back into the jungle, and when Peeta wants to go collect water, Johanna won’t let him. Katniss realizes that the other tributes are trying to keep Peeta alive, but she doesn’t know why. Just then Katniss hears what sounds like her little sister screaming and rushes off to find it. It’s only a jabberjay, a bird the Capitol created that can mimic any sound it hears. Finnick hears one, too, that sounds like a woman named “Annie.” Katniss later learns that Annie is a victor from District 4 who went half-crazy surviving her Games. Finnick is in love with her. That night, Peeta tells Katniss she has to survive for the sake of her family, and he and Katniss spend the night together holding each other and kissing. The next morning, Beetee has a plan. At twelve noon and midnight each day, lightning strikes a tree on the island. By running a highly conductive wire Beetee has from the tree to the ocean, they can electrocute a large area of water and whatever sand is wet. He thinks the other remaining tributes would move to the beach if they left. If so, those tributes would be electrocuted.", "\n", "They hike to the tree and wrap the wire around it, and Katniss and Johanna begin carrying it back to the beach. Suddenly the wire is cut, and before Katniss knows what’s happening, Johanna hits her in the head and cuts something out of her arm. Katniss, still dizzy, thinks they’re trying to kill her and Peeta and heads back to the tree. She sees Beetee with the same arm wound holding a knife with the wire wrapped around it and realizes what he was trying to do. She wraps the wire around one of her arrows and fires it through a small, visible gap in the force field just as lightning strikes. The shock causes the force field to go down and knocks Katniss unconscious. She wakes to find a hovercraft retrieving her. On board are Haymitch, Finnick, and Plutarch Heavensbee, and they explain everything. Plutarch has for years been part of a secret rebel group, and many of the tributes were involved in a plot to bring down the force field around the island so they could escape. What they cut out of her arm was a tracking device. Several of the districts are now in a full-scale revolt, and their hovercraft is headed to District 13.", "\n", "Lastly, they tell Katniss they kept Peeta alive in the arena only because they knew she wouldn’t help them if he died. They need her because she’s the mockingjay, the symbol of the rebellion. But Peeta and Johanna couldn’t be rescued. They were taken by the Capitol. Katniss attacks Haymitch, feeling he used her and Peeta. She’s sedated, and when she comes to, Gale is there. He explains the Capitol started dropping bombs after the Games.

To begin with, Katniss and Peeta have to act as if they’re in love so that the Capitol can keep up the lie that their threat of suicide at the end of the previous novel was simply the desperate act of two love-crazed teenagers and not a gesture of defiance. That fear speaks to the power of appearances, since as President Snow explains to Katniss, if people saw Katniss as a rebel, that alone could encourage the districts to revolt. Katniss, it turns out, has already become a symbol of the rebellion, but again the appearance doesn’t reflect the truth. Katniss has no involvement with any organized rebel movement and doesn’t even know one exists for most of the novel. She even spends the first part of the novel trying to appease President Snow and keeping up the love act with Peeta in the hopes of subduing any potential uprisings. (Admittedly, she isn’t very successful and actually does end up encouraging people to defy the Capitol.) In both situations, however, what’s important isn’t what Katniss actually believes or feels. Her value to both sides is primarily as a symbol, which suggests that her image is perhaps more powerful than she is herself.", "Gradually, we learn that Katniss isn’t the only character maintaining a public persona that doesn’t correspond with reality. Plutarch Heavensbee, the new Head Gamemaker, is revealed to be part of the rebellion. Finnick isn’t the shallow womanizer he appears to be, and several tributes, including some like Finnick who’ve enjoyed fame and wealth in the Capitol, are actually part of the rebellion. Many of the events in the Quarter Quell also turn out to be covers for hidden agendas. The tributes’ efforts to keep Peeta alive have nothing to do with turning him into a leader, as Katniss believes, but are just to keep Katniss cooperating with them. Some aspects of the Quarter Quell itself were even engineered to help the tributes escape, notably the wire Beetee invented being included among the weapons. The last chapters of the novel largely center on Katniss finally coming to understand the truth of many of these events. In most of these cases, the reason for the false public image is fear of the Capitol, which harshly punishes dissent of any sort. The power of the lie is that, as long as the Capitol believes it has control, it allows the rebels to work without detection to undo that control."], "The Struggle for Control": ["Much of the conflict in the novel revolves around a struggle for control, with the Capitol always at one end trying to maintain control and various characters or groups on the other trying to take back control. Katniss’s confrontation with President Snow essentially centers on this idea. He wants to dictate nearly everything she does even down to what she wears, as when he selects the dress she wears for the tributes’ interview with Caesar Flickerman. The control President Snow exerts over Katniss parallels the control the Capitol wants over all the people in Panem. Through its laws and the squads of Peacekeepers it deploys to enforce them, the Capitol systematically maintain control over all the districts. Any act that defies the Capitol’s control results in harsh punishment. Notably, the Hunger Games themselves are meant as a reminder to the people that they have no control and that they have to obey the Capitol.", "All the forms of rebellion we see in the novel are variations on people regaining, or at least fighting to regain, control. When Katniss tells Peeta she doesn’t want to be a pawn in the Capitol’s Games, she’s saying she doesn’t want to be controlled. When we see how Haymitch rebelliously won his Games, it was by finding a loophole in the Capitol’s control—since the Capitol never intended the force field to be used as a weapon—and exploiting it. The reason the mockingjay is symbolic is that it represents the Capitol’s lack of control, since the bird was actually an unintended consequence of a weapon created for use against the rebels that ultimately backfired. What the rebels want is to retake control of their lives and no longer have the Capitol forcing them to live by its restrictive laws and do things like sacrifice their children in the Hunger Games.", "This fight for control is precisely why Katniss has become a symbol of the rebellion. At the end of the Hunger Games, when she had the idea for her and Peeta to commit suicide, she was essentially rejecting the rules set up by the Capitol. In doing so, she denied the Capitol control of her life and took it back into her own hands. The act evident set a precedent for all the viewers watching at home, suggesting that they too could take back control from the Capitol."], "The Ignorance of the Privileged": ["The privileged of Panem are chiefly those people who live in the Capitol, and their ignorance stems from the fact that they’re insulated from the hardships faced by the people in the districts. They are relatively wealthy and always have enough to eat. They aren’t forced into exhausting and often dangerous labor. Their children also don’t have to participate in the Hunger Games. Because their lives are so comfortable and secure, they generally don’t have to think of things that people in the districts think of, such as how to feed their families. As a result, many if not all are oblivious to the harsh realities that most of the people in Panem face."]}}, "quotes": {"link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/catching-fire/quotes/", "important_quotations_explained": {"1. “He means there’s only one future, if I want to keep those I love alive and stay alive myself. I’ll have to marry Peeta.” ": ["This realization strikes Katniss after she tells Haymitch about President Snow’s visit to her house, and it ties into the theme of fighting for control that runs throughout the novel. During his visit, President Snow threatens to harm Katniss’s loved ones, singling out Gale in particular, if she fails to convince people that she and Peeta are in love. Only by making people believe that fiction can the Capitol act as if Katniss’s and Peeta’s threat of suicide at the end of the Hunger Games was just the act of two love-crazed teenagers rather than open defiance. As President Snow explains, if people think Katniss was deliberately defying the Capitol, it could encourage others to do the same, possibly leading to uprisings in the districts. Katniss agrees to do what she can, but what she gradually comes to understand is that there will be no end point to the lying. To keep her loved ones safe, she’ll have to continue acting publicly as if she’s in love with Peeta indefinitely, which means they’ll eventually have to get married to avoid raising questions.", "Katniss is distraught over this realization, but not because the thought of marrying Peeta is so terrible to her. What she despises about the notion is the Capitol controlling her for essentially the rest of her life. She recognizes that at no point in the foreseeable future will the Capitol leave her alone, and that she’ll always be looking over her shoulder to see if she’s being spied on. Moreover, she’ll have to think through every public gesture and action to make sure it doesn’t offend the Capitol. A single wrong move, even if it’s committed out of carelessness and not defiance, could mean her friends or family being hurt or killed in retaliation. The marriage is just one more way that the Capitol will have control over her and everything she cares about."], "2. “A mockingjay is a creature the Capitol never intended to exist.” ": ["Katniss has this thought as she and Madge talk about the mockingjay pin Madge gave her before the Hunger Games, and it hints at the symbolic meaning of the mockingjay in the novel. The origins of the mockingjay represent a lapse of control for the Capitol. During the first rebellion, the Capitol had genetically engineered a bird called the jabberjay, which could memorize and repeat long strings of words. It used them to spy on the rebels, but the rebels then began using the birds to misinform the Capitol. The Capitol tried to eliminate the birds, but they had already started breeding with wild mockingbirds, resulting in the mockingjay. It’s a sign of failure on the part of the Capitol, and the bird is for that reason an appropriate symbol for the current rebellion.", "But the quote takes on an additional meaning in the context of Katniss’s discovering that she’s the symbol of the rebellion. Katniss, like the original mockingjay, also represents a lapse of control for the Capitol. When she had the idea to threaten suicide at the end of the Games, knowing the Capitol wouldn’t let her go through with it, she took back control of her life from the Capitol, even if just momentarily. In addition, that this event occurred during the finale of the Hunger Games when most of Panem was watching made it highly symbolic. The Capitol’s attempt to control Katniss essentially backfired and turned Katniss into a symbol of defiance. Like the mockingjay, Katniss became a symbol the Capitol never intended to exist."], "3. “Why did you do it anyway?” he says. “I don’t know. To show them that I’m more than just a piece in their Games?” I say. ": ["In this snippet of conversation, Katniss replies to Peeta when he asks why she decided on her blatantly rebellious demonstration to the Gamemakers. Notably, the quote recalls something Peeta said in the first novel of the series before he and Katniss competed in the Hunger Games. In that instance, he was saying he didn’t want the Games to change his character and change him into a killer. He wanted to maintain his integrity and humanity. It was a form of rebellion against the Capitol and the Games, which dehumanize the tributes by turning their slaughter into entertainment. Katniss echoes that rebellion here, though her reasoning is different. What she did in her demonstration was pretend to hang a dummy with the name of the previous Head Gamemaker, Seneca Crane, written on the front. Seneca Crane was executed after Katniss’s and Peeta’s suicide stunt at the end of the Games, and the act was intended to remind the Gamemakers of his fate and suggest that they could suffer the same. Katniss’s act, in other words, was an attack on the Gamemakers and wasn’t about maintaining her personal integrity.", "Maybe more importantly, it was also intended to show them that they couldn’t control her. The Capitol strictly regiments everything that occurs in Panem using the threat of violence to keep people in line. The Games are perhaps the best example. They exist to remind the districts that the Capitol can crush them at will and to make them feel powerless. It’s that control that Katniss and many of the people in the districts rebel against. Katniss’s demonstration showed that she wasn’t afraid of displease them and displayed a contemptuous disregard for their control. When Katniss tells Peeta she did it to show them she’s more than a piece in their Games, she means quite literally that she wanted to make it clear that they can’t determine how she behaves."], "4. “My prep team. My foolish, shallow, affectionate pets, with their obsessions with feathers and parties, nearly break my heart with their good-bye.” (p. 247) ": ["This quote appears as Katniss’s prep team finishes her hair and makeup just before she does the tribute interview with Caesar Flickerman. It reveals the mixed feelings Katniss has about the team and the people in the Capitol more generally. Katniss feels consistently shocked by the superficial concerns of her team since her concerns, and those of everyone in the districts, are far more consequential. While her prep team worries about parties and how they look, Katniss worries about the safety of her family and friends and whether they have enough to eat. At the same time, however, Katniss knows her team genuinely cares about her, and she’s come to feel real affection for Venia, Octavia, and Flavius. She looks down on them for their shallowness, but she also recognizes that they’re just a product of the Capitol. They’ve never known the sorts of hardships that she and the people in the districts endure on a daily basis.", "The quote ties directly into the theme of the ignorance of the privileged. At various times in the novel we see how the people of the Capitol live oblivious to the suffering of the people in the districts. The most notable example is the feast at President Snow’s mansion. On learning that people in Capitol make themselves vomit so they can continue gorging, Katniss’s thoughts turn immediately to the many people she knows are starving in her home district. She finds the thought anyone would waste food in such a way when others are in such desperate need appalling and insulting, because they show no regard for the suffering going on outside the Capitol that could be alleviated with the food they’re wasting. The Hunger Games themselves are another example of the ignorance that the privileged enjoy. It’s easy for the people in the Capitol to view the Games as entertainment because it’s not their children who are competing. They quite literally don’t know the anguish the Games cause for the families of the children who are chosen because they never have to experience it firsthand. Katniss’s quote acknowledges this sort of ignorance, but it also suggests that her prep team and the people in the Capitol more generally aren’t entirely responsible for it. They’re products of their environment. If Katniss didn’t take this detail into account, she most likely wouldn’t feel any affection for her prep team."], "5. “The bird, the pin, the song, the berries, the watch, the cracker, the dress that burst into flames. I am the mockingjay. The one that survived despite the Capitol’s plans. The symbol of the rebellion.” (p. 387) ": ["Katniss has this epiphany at the end of the novel, after Plutarch Heavensbee explains to her why the rebellion needed to keep her alive through the Quarter Quell. She suddenly realizes the significance of several events tied to the idea of the mockingjay and for the first time understands how they’re all connected. The bird refers to the mockingjay that represents her. The song is what the old man in District 11 whistled, the same one Katniss and Rue used to communicate with one another through the mockingjays. The pin is the mockingjay pin Madge gave her that she wore through the Games and came to be associated with. The berries are the ones she and Peeta threatened to eat to commit suicide, and in doing so made Katniss a beacon of defiance to the districts. The watch is the one Plutarch Heavensbee showed her with the vanishing mockingjay on its face. The cracker is what the refugees from District 8 held out to her with the mockingjay stamped on it. The dress refers to the one Cinna created for her that burned away, leaving her wearing the mockingjay costume.", "At that moment Katniss recognizes that a vast movement has been underway to bring down the Capitol, and without even knowing it, she has been its symbol. She herself is represented by the mockingjay that, like herself, the Capitol never intended to exist and survived despite the Capitol’s plans. And like the mockingjay, she’s also become something the Capitol can’t control. As Katniss puts all these pieces together, she comes to other realizations as well. She recognizes that the rebellion has reached further than she ever imagined if Plutarch, the Head Gamemaker, is part of it. She also understands that Haymitch has known all of this information all along and not shared any of it with her. The thought causes her to feel immensely betrayed, since he’s long been one of the few people she believes she can trust. Instead she feels used by Haymitch for the sake of the rebellion. As a result, she doesn’t feel any joy about these revelations, only betrayal. In essence Haymitch and Plutarch used her image for publicity without allowing her any control over it, in a similar vein to how the Capitol has used her image to promote the Hunger Games."]}}}

As the literary scholar T.A. Shippey\nargues, the images of evil -Tolkien portrays in the novel depict\ntwo traditional explanations for the existence of evil. The first,\nManichaeism, was a view deemed heretical by the early Christian\nchurch. In Manichaeism, good and evil are two opposing forces or\npowers at war in the world. The second view, embraced by early Christian\ntheologians, is that evil does not exist as a positive force. Evil\nis, instead, a human creation—that which is produced by humankind’s\nlack of goodness.", "The Shadow, the chief metaphor for the evil of Mordor,\nexemplifies this ambivalent depiction of evil. On one hand, shadow\nis nothing but the absence of light; it has no substance, and its\nqualities are ambiguous even to those who perceive it. At the same\ntime, shadows are real objects, with clearly visible shapes and\nedges. With the Shadow that blankets Mordor and extends outward\nlater in ", "The Lord of the Rings,", " Sauron’s evil spreads\nas various groups of Men and Orcs obey his will. In this sense,\nSauron’s evil is not a force or a thing, but a form of human behavior.\nEven so, Sauron’s Darkness affects the physical world itself. The\nland of Mordor lies destitute and barren because of Sauron’s residence\nthere, and the flying Nazgûl represent the physical embodiment of\na mystical evil force.", "While Tolkien does not clarify this ambiguous picture\nof evil, he suggests that the evil of human behavior precedes the\nphysical force or power of evil in the world. Sauron creates the\nRing out of malice and pride; the Ring does not cause Sauron’s evil.\nSimilarly, the evil Saruman never actually loses his mystical powers\nwhen ousted from Isengard. Saruman’s hatred and bitterness cause\nhis psychological deterioration, and his physical loss of power\nfollows suit."], "The Importance of Redemption": ["Redemption—the ability to renew another’s life—is a capacity\nthat few of the Fellowship’s members possess. As the rightful King\nof Gondor, only Aragorn can redeem another by his power, as his words\npossess the ability to direct, by royal edict, the fate of his subjects.\nNevertheless, throughout ", "The Lord of the Rings,", " the\nprotagonists are faced with opportunities to extend mercy to others,\noften at the risk of losing sight of the goal of their larger mission.\nTolkien suggests that mercy must always be extended to others, regardless\nof the risks such an offering poses.", "Gandalf and Frodo, more than any other characters, repeatedly offer\nmercy and the possibility of redemption to others. At Minas Tirith,\nGandalf turns from pursuing the Lord of the Nazgûl to save Faramir\nfrom the burning pyre and to offer aid and a second chance to the\ndesperate Lord Denethor. Gandalf continually offers redemption to\nthe corrupt wizard Saruman up through their last meeting. Time and\nagain, Frodo offers mercy to Gollum, pardoning Gollum’s offenses\nand entrusting his journey to the creature and his devices. Often,\nthe offer of redemption jeopardizes the success of the quest itself. ", "By having Gandalf and Frodo extend second chances to others again\nand again, Tolkien emphasizes the importance of free will. Gandalf’s\nintervention in ", "The Two Towers ", "transforms Théoden, who\nsuddenly realizes that evil is not his only available choice. Denethor’s\nevil, in contrast, stems from his belief that Sauron’s evil lies\nare an inescapable necessity. Furthermore, Tolkien suggests that the\nact of offering redemption demonstrates a trust in the justice of providence\nor fate. Gollum ultimately betrays Frodo’s confidence, trying to\ndestroy Frodo to gain the Ring. Frodo’s patience with Gollum, however,\nprompts the creature to follow Frodo all the way to the Cracks of\nDoom. In the end, good does come of Gollum, as, in a cruel twist\nof irony, his mischief destroys the Ring in the Cracks of Doom."], "The Priority of Friendship": ["The common concept of friendship might appear too simple\nor trite to have such great importance in an epic novel, but Tolkien’s\npicture of true friendship is at times grave and demanding. Tolkien\nsuggests that even the all-important quest itself should be suspended\nfor the sake of devotion to one’s friends. Sam’s deeds in Mordor\ndisplay the ultimate courage, for he must constantly decide between\nfidelity to his friend Frodo or the forward movement of the Ring.\nIn the dead silence of Mordor, Sam risks discovery by singing aloud\nin order to find his way to Frodo’s hidden cell. For Sam, true friendship\nmeans absolute devotion to another person. This absolute devotion involves\na denial of the self and the willingness to sacrifice one’s own life\nfor one’s friend.", "At the same time, Tolkien’s exploration of friendship\nremains refreshing in its lightheartedness. The companions of the\nFellowship make few vows of deep or serious friendship to each other.\nRather, friendship in the novel frequently means being content with\nthe company of another person. As Frodo leisurely tells Sam while\nMordor collapses around them, “I am glad you are here with me .\n. . at the end of all things.” Gandalf closes the novel by quietly\nbidding Sam, Merry, and Pippin to return home, “for it will be better\nto ride back three together than one alone.”"]}}, "quotes": {"link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/returnking/quotes/", "important_quotations_explained": {"“You\ncannot enter here. . . .

Instead, the wizard uses\nhuman speech to invoke the powers of good over the powers of evil.\nGandalf speaks with authority, as though performing a priestly duty, intervening\nwith the unseen god or gods of Middle-earth on behalf of Minas Tirith.\nInterestingly, only Pippin, who observes the standoff, knows of\nthe sins that Denethor, the Steward of Minas Tirith, is preparing\nto commit in the Citadel as Gandalf attempts to thwart the physical\nemblem of evil from entering the city.", "In instructing the Lord of the Nazgûl to leave, Gandalf\npresents the Black Captain with a moral choice. The wizard offers\nbrief redemption to the Black Captain, granting the creature the\nopportunity to make a moral choice in favor of good rather than\ncompleting the evil errand he has been sent to perform. However,\nthe likelihood that the violent Ringwraith, given wholly over to\nevil, might change his mind because of a verbal rebuke is remote\nat best. Gandalf’s words imply the assumption that the Lord of the\nNazgûl has free will when it comes to choosing between good and\nevil. As servants of Sauron, however, the evil of the armies of\nMordor resides in their corruption at the hands of the Dark Lord,\ntheir enslavement to his will, and their conviction they do not\nhave such a choice to turn to the side of good."], "“I\nwould have things as they were in all the days of my life . . .\nand in the days of my longfathers before me: to be the Lord of this\nCity in peace, and leave my chair to a son after me, who would be\nhis own master and no wizard’s pupil.

": ["This insight into Sam’s thoughts about\nthe Ring at Cirith Ungol in Book VI, Chapter ", "1", ",\nexplains the key virtue of the hobbits as Ring-bearers and members\nof the Fellowship. Frodo’s and Sam’s small statures—both in terms\nof physical size and force of authority and personality—grant them\na perspective that does not suit the Ring’s overwhelming power.\nThe small size of the Hobbit race also functions as a metaphor for\ntheir measured attitudes, their humility, and their unadorned goodness—attributes\nthat appear to make them less vulnerable to the lure of the Ring.\nThe Hobbits and the Shire are little known in Middle-earth; throughout ", "The\nLord of the Rings", ", the races of Men and Elves are surprised\nto learn that Hobbits actually exist. Frodo, by accepting the Ring,\nenters a history of war and conflict between Men and the forces\nof evil in which the Hobbits have had little part. As the symbol\nof that conflict, the Ring always seems like an awkward fit on a\nHobbit hand.", "Despite the seeming incompatibility of the Hobbit race\nas a whole with the lure of the Ring, we still get the sense that\nFrodo and Sam are exceptional Hobbits, with a strength of character\nthat makes them less vulnerable to the Ring’s power. After all,\nwe know that Gollum, though once a Hobbit-like creature, was still\ncorrupted by the Ring, and we have seen that the Ring is able to\nelicit erratic behavior and sudden fierceness in Bilbo. Frodo and\nSam, on the other hand, are evidence that Hobbit virtues are only\nvirtues insofar as one exhibits them. At Cirith Ungol, Sam proves\nthat he has developed from a slightly dim-witted youth to a mature\nhobbit with a deep capacity for discernment and reflection. Deeply\ninfluenced by Frodo’s experiences with the burden of the quest,\nSam analyzes the Ring and immediately realizes and respects its\nsubtle, destructive potential. Perhaps most important, Sam’s desire\nto use the Ring himself springs only from his love for Frodo and\nhis attempts to save his master. In this sense, Sam’s affection\nfor Frodo acts as a corrective to the Ring’s power. Sam muses that,\neven if the tantalizing benefits of the Ring were an actual possibility\nrather than a false promise, they would not really be benefits if\nthey involved losing his hobbit sense and his affection for Frodo.\nIn this regard, Sam’s resilient love for his friend precludes his\nfascination with the Ring’s power."], "“But\ndo you remember Gandalf’s words: Even Gollum may have something\nyet to do? But for him, Sam, I could not have destroyed the Ring.\nThe Quest would have been in vain, even at the bitter end. So let\nus forgive him!

Here at the end of all things, Sam.” ": ["Frodo shares this calm reflection with\nSam at the end of Book VI, Chapter ", "3", ", as\nMount Doom explodes and crumbles around them. Their somewhat leisurely\nconversation belies the fact that they have suffered from exhaustion\nand physical danger for so long, as well as the fact that Mordor\nis rupturing into a virtual apocalypse around them. The moment highlights\none of Tolkien’s strongest narrative devices—the juxtaposition of\nintimate personal moments against the backdrop of cosmic or earthly\ncrises. This tension between the great and the small drives the\nentire plot of ", "The Lord of the Rings", "—which revolves\naround the idea of two lowly hobbits not simply embarking on a quest\nbut, as the critic Roger Sale puts it, descending into hell. Tolkien\nuses the device to emphasize the deep friendship between Frodo and\nSam. Not only does the physical destruction of Mount Doom signal\nthe climax of Tolkien’s tale, but it also suggests that the moment\nrepresents the pinnacle of the two hobbits’ friendship.", "Frodo himself points out another irony: it is not he who\nfinishes the quest they have traveled so far to achieve, but Gollum,\nthe Ring’s greatest hoarder, who has completed the task.

Either\nway, a sense of divine providence and fate looms over the events\nthat transpire at the Cracks of Doom, evoking a perfect blend of\nchance and retribution in Gollum’s fall. In this regard, Frodo and Sam’s\ncalm discussion of Gollum’s actions in light of the destruction around\nthem hints that a greater, unknown power of good is protecting them."], "“But\nI have been too deeply hurt, Sam. I tried to save the Shire, and\nit has been saved, but not for me.

From Adam and Eve’s first disobedient act\nin the garden, each biblical book affirms that human evil is the\ninevitable result of human disobedience, not of God’s malice or\nneglect. The first chapters of Genesis depict God as disappointed\nor “grieved” by human wickedness, suggesting that the humans, rather\nthan God, are responsible for human evil (Genesis 6:6).\nLater books, such as Judges and Kings, show God’s repeated attempts\nto sway the Israelites from the effects of their evil. These stories\nemphasize the human capacity to reject God’s help, implying that\nthe responsibility for evil lies with humanity. Judges echoes with\nthe ominous phrase, “The Israelites again did what was evil in the\nsight of the Lord . . .” (Judges 3:12).", "The most troublesome challenge to God’s goodness, however,\nis the existence of natural evil, which is the undeserved destruction and\npain humans often experience. God repeatedly instructs the Israelites\nto destroy entire cities, killing men, women, and children in the\nprocess. The Book of Job directly questions God’s implication in\nnatural evil. God punishes Job harshly for no other reason than\nto prove to Satan that Job is religiously faithful. In the end,\nGod declares to Job that God’s powerful ways are beyond human understanding\nand should not be questioned. The book implies that God sometimes\nuses natural evil as a rhetorical device—as a means of displaying\nhis power or of proving a point in a world already tainted by human\ncorruption."], "The Possibility of Redemption ": ["God typically responds to human behavior with retributive\njustice, meaning that people get what they deserve. God punishes\nthe evil and blesses the righteous. The theme of mercy and redemption, which\ndevelops throughout the biblical stories, contrasts with this standard\nof retribution.", "Redemption appears in two forms in the Old Testament.\nSometimes, one person forgives another by simply forgetting or ignoring\nthe other’s offense. When Jacob returns to his homeland after cheating\nhis brother, we expect hatred and vengeance from Esau. Instead, Esau welcomes\nJacob with a joyful embrace, reversing Jacob’s expectations no less\nthan Jacob has already reversed Esau’s fate. Similarly, King David\ntreats his enemies with kindness and mercy, a policy that often seems\nshortsighted in its dismissal of traditional justice.", "Another form of redemption involves the intervention\nof a third party as a mediator or sacrifice to quell God’s anger\nwith the wrongdoers. Moses’s frantic prayers at Mount Sinai frequently\ncause God to “change his mind” and relent from destroying the Israelites\n(Exodus 32:14). In\nthe Book of Judges, Samson sacrifices his life to redeem the Israelites\nfrom the Philistine oppression brought on by Israel’s incessant\nevil. These human acts of redemption mirror God’s promise in the\nreligious laws to forgive the people’s sins on the basis of ritual\nanimal sacrifices and offerings."], "The Virtue of Faith ": ["In the Old Testament, faith is a resilient belief in the\none true God and an unshakable obedience to his will. The models\nof biblical faith are not those who are supported by organized religion\nbut those who choose to trust in God at the most unpopular times.\nPart of the virtue of true faith is the ability to believe in God\nwhen he remains unseen. The Israelites betray their complete lack\nof faith when they complain after God repeatedly shows himself and\ndisplays miracles during the exodus from Egypt."]}}, "quotes": {"link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oldtestament/quotes/", "important_quotations_explained": {"I\nwill make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you,\nand kings shall come from you. I will establish my covenant between\nme and you, and your offspring after you throughout their generations,\nfor an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring\nafter you. And I will give to you, and to your offspring after you,\nthe land where you are now an alien, all the land of Canaan, for\na perpetual holding; and I will be their God. (Genesis 17:6–8) ": ["These words, spoken by God, articulate\nGod’s covenant, or promise, with Abraham. Initially in the Genesis\nnarrative, the interaction between God and humans seems bewildering\nand arbitrary. God speaks to isolated individuals and demands certain\nactions from them. Here, God lays out a plan for an ongoing relationship\nwith humankind. God will be the deity of one group of people, and\nthe rights to God’s favor and blessings will pass on genetically\nfrom one man to his descendants. The rewards of this relationship\nwill not only be a nation and a homeland for the Israelites but\nabundant, “fruitful” life. God’s comments here serve two functions.\nFirst, the passage introduces the dominant motif of the Old Testament:\nthe covenant unifies the biblical narrative, for everything the\nIsraelites do from this point on represents either an affirmation\nor a rejection of God’s promise. Second, the passage implies that\nthe Israelites are not just any group or ethnicity, but a specific\npeople descending from one man with a divine claim to land in the\neastern Mediterranean region. Historically, the idea of the covenant\nwas important for the Israelites in sustaining a sense of identity\nin the ethnic mix of the region as well as during the exile."], "Hear,\nO Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord alone. You shall love the\nLord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with\nall your might. Keep these words that I am commanding you today\nin your heart. Recite them to your children and talk about them\nwhen you are at home and when you are away, when you lie down and\nwhen you rise. Bind them as a sign on your hand, fix them as an emblem\non your forehead. (Deuteronomy 6:4–8) ": ["Stationed on the border of the promised\nLand, Moses delivers these instructions in his farewell address\nto the Israelites. In one sense, his speech, which constitutes the\nBook of Deuteronomy, is redundant. Moses reiterates many of the\nreligious laws and commandments already stated by God in the Book\nof Leviticus and the latter half of Exodus. However, Moses is speaking\nto a new, younger generation of Israelites who, after wandering\nthe desert for forty years, are now ready to take the land sworn\nto them by God, a land they have never seen. Just as the history\nof Israel is at a turning point, so Moses describes the laws and\nthe covenant in terms very different than before. Previously, the\nsymbols of God’s covenant have been external: the rite of circumcision,\nthe Ark of the Covenant, and various rules for physical cleanliness.\nNow, Moses describes the laws as internal to the Israelites. The\nreligious laws are words and ideas that should be so precious to\nthe Israelites that they are in their “heart[s],” remaining with\nthe people wherever they go. This passage suggests why Judaism refers\nto the biblical laws as “Torah”: laws that are not just rules for\nbehavior but models for all of life."], "Has\nthe Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obedience to the voice of the Lord? Surely, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed than the fat of rams. . . . Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, he has also rejected you from being king. (1 Samuel 15:22–23) ": ["The prophet Samuel pronounces\nthis grim curse to Saul after Saul disobeys God. Through Samuel,\nGod has instructed King Saul to attack the neighboring Amalekites\nand destroy them completely, sparing nothing. Saul, however, has\nbrought back the Amalekite flocks as booty, apparently to use as\na ritual animal sacrifice to God. This seemingly benign error not\nonly earns God’s wrath but justifies the removal of Saul as king\nof Israel. As such, the oversight marks a turning a point in the\nhistory of Israel, permitting David’s ascent to the throne. More important,\nthe nature of Saul’s error implies a new outlook on religious obedience.\nObedience is not adherence to God’s laws but obedience to God himself.\nAs Samuel suggests, God honors obedience to that which is unseen—“the\nvoice of the Lord”—more than obedience to that which is seen—physical\nregulations and ceremonies. Valuing the unseen over the seen is\nintegral to the theme of radical faith in the Old Testament. Saul\ndoes not possess this faith, yet his tragic demise over such a fine\ndistinction earns our sympathy."], "If\nI sin, what do I do to you, you watcher of humanity? Why have you made me your target? Why have I become a burden to you? (Job 7:20) ": ["This rhetorical question is\nspoken by Job after God has killed all his children and his livestock,\nand afflicted him with a skin disease. Job’s lament is emblematic\nof the central question discussed by Job and his three friends.\nThe question is a theme in the Old Testament: how can God remain\ngood despite the fact that he allows evil and human suffering to\nexist? Job’s friends argue that God would only afflict Job with pain\nif he had committed some grave act of human disobedience meriting\npunishment. Job, however, raises two complaints against God, the “watcher\nof humanity.” For one, Job knows he has done nothing wrong, and\nhe wonders what he could have done to become a “burden” to God and\ndeserve such suffering. Second, Job asks why God is so concerned\nwith human actions in the first place—why he watches humanity’s\nfaults and punishes them in turn. Just as Job’s lament is rhetorical\nand open-ended, so this question and theme is not explicitly answered\nin the Old Testament."], "For\neverything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted; a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance. . . . (Ecclesiastes 3:1–4) ": ["These famous verses are spoken by the\nunnamed Teacher who investigates the meaning of life in the Book\nof Ecclesiastes. The poetic interlude in the Teacher’s musings represents\nan excellent example of the parallelism that defines biblical poetry:\nthe lyrical verse has rhythm because each line is divided into two\nhalves, both of which mirror and oppose each other at the same time.\nMore important, the Teacher’s saying continues the pattern of doubles\nand opposites developed throughout the Old Testament narrative.\nSince God’s creation in Genesis, the Old Testament depicts the world\nas a place of opposing forces—good versus evil, greater versus lesser,\nlight versus dark, seen versus unseen. The Old Testament frequently\nreverses these opposites, showing the younger dominating over the\nolder, the weak over the strong, and the oppressed over the powerful.\nThis motif suggests that humans cannot confidently discern that\nwhich is better or worse without faith in God. Similarly, the Teacher\nexplains that there is a time for every human experience, good and\nbad. One cannot say that dancing is obviously better than mourning,\nfor both experiences are integral to human life. The Teacher argues\nthat trying to find meaning in life by what people traditionally\nassume to be better or worse is misguided, and that the only correct\nway for humans to behave is to fear, or obey, God."]}}}

Unlike Muriel, who is fixated on appearances and class, Sybil can communicate with Seymour in a way that calms him. By speaking Sybil’s language, Seymour may hope to reconnect to or return to a childlike, innocent state. Children and their world seem to hold the possibility of redemption.\n", "A return to innocence proves to be impossible for Seymour. Though he is clearly distanced from Muriel emotionally, she is very much physically present. Their hotel room is suffused with the scents of her calfskin luggage and nail polish remover, and the physical space they share—in the car as they drove to Florida, in their hotel room, and at the resort—is small. Seymour’s self-isolation is temporary at best, as he opts out of parties to play the piano or retreats to the beach. The world of childhood innocence has long been lost for Seymour, and he chooses suicide as an escape from the oppressive adult world in which he must otherwise live as an outsider.\n"]}}, "quotes": {"link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/a-perfect-day-for-bananafish/quotes/", "important_quotations_explained": {"1.\t“Did you see more glass?” “Pussycat, stop saying that. It’s driving Mommy absolutely crazy.” ": ["This exchange between Sybil and her mother, which appears about halfway through the story, is an example of how difficult clear communication is for the characters in the story. While Sybil is referring to Seymour Glass, Mrs. Carpenter hears “see more glass” and thinks Sybil is being silly. Mother and daughter are speaking different languages—Seymour Glass is a figure who exists solely in Sybil’s world of childhood, whereas the phonetic interpretation, “see more glass,” is Mrs. Carpenter’s adult take on the phrase. This exchange also reveals Sybil as an outsider in her mother’s adult world, just as Seymour is. This exchange is markedly different from the conversations between Sybil and Seymour. Seymour, unlike Mrs. Carpenter, understands Sybil and is kind and patient with her—in a way, he speaks the language of childhood.\n"], "2.\t“If you want to look at my feet, say so,” said the young man. “But don’t be a God-damned sneak about it.” ": ["As Seymour returns to his room at the end of the story, he accuses a woman in the elevator of looking at his feet. When she denies this claim, he becomes irate. This unfounded anger illustrates two parts of Seymour’s character. First, such a violent and unprovoked outburst shows that he really is mentally unstable. While Muriel has spoken with her mother about Seymour’s psychological condition, this is the only direct evidence in the story that Seymour is in fact not well. Second, Seymour is angry with the woman for being a “sneak”—that is, for being inauthentic. This is a criticism against the materialistic world of the hotel, where appearances rule. Shortly after this exchange, Seymour commits suicide, and in a way, this outburst is an attempt to have one final interaction or communication with the adult world. His effort is inappropriate and disturbing, but its violence reveals the extent of Seymour’s psychological distress.\n"], "3.\tThen he went over sat down on the unoccupied bed, looked at the girl, aimed the pistol, and fired a bullet through his right temple. ": ["The final sentences of the story demonstrate Salinger’s control of language to create tone and tension. These short phrases portray Seymour’s actions as calm and matter-of-fact—there is no room for doubt or hesitation in the abrupt phrases. Tension builds as the actions pile up, and until the last moment, there is some ambiguity about whom Seymour will shoot—this may be the crazy act that Muriel’s mother worried Seymour would perpetrate. Instead, Seymour shoots himself, ending his life and the story at the same time. The suicide is so sudden, and at first Seymour’s reasons for doing it seem wholly unclear—he seems unhappy and cut off from the world, yes, but his afternoon on the beach with Sybil did little to suggest that this was to come. However, the story can be read as a slow, simmering buildup of actions and problems, which makes Seymour’s suicide shocking but not necessarily a surprise.\n"]}}}

Pilgrimage\ndepends on travel, and so a pilgrim must be a voyager prepared to\ngo far and wide. Yet in Bunyan’s book, voyage in itself does not\nmake a traveler a pilgrim. The pilgrim must advance spiritually\nas he or she advances geographically. The key factor is knowledge,\nwhich must increase as the pilgrim proceeds forward. Christian never\nmakes the same mistake twice or meets the same foe twice, because\nhe learns from his experiences. Once he experiences the Slough of\nDespond, he never needs to be despondent again. Other pilgrims who\nlack understanding may advance fairly far, like Heedless and Too-bold,\nwho almost get to the Celestial City; however, they do not understand\nwhat they undergo, and so they only babble nonsense and talk in\ntheir sleep. They are travelers but are not pilgrims because they\ncannot verbalize or spiritually grasp what they have been through."], "The Importance of Reading": ["The importance of reading is emphasized throughout ", "The\nPilgrim’s Progress", " because the pilgrims reach salvation\nand happiness by understanding the Bible. The pilgrims who have\nnot read and do not understand the Bible are viewed as disappointments,\nwho will not gain entry to the Celestial City. For example, when\nChristian dismisses the good lad Ignorant, he does so only because\nIgnorant cannot grasp divine revelation as conveyed by the Bible.\nIn effect, he rejects Ignorant because he cannot read. Another example\nis in the first stage of the book when the narrator falls asleep\nand first glimpses Christian, who is crying and holding a book.\nThe book is the Bible and it strikes pain into the heart of the\nbeliever who has strayed from its message. Though pilgrims may read\nthe Bible, they also must believe its message and apply it to their\neveryday lives. Reading is necessary even for death. When Christiana\nreceives her summons to the Master and takes leave of the world,\nthe summons is sent in the form of a letter. If she could not read\nit, she would never meet her maker. Reading is not merely a skill\nin life but the key to attaining salvation."], "The Value of Community": ["The value of community is portrayed in Part II through\nChristiana’s journey to the Celestial City with her children and\na few other companions. As a result, Christiana experiences pilgrimage\nitself as a communal activity. Every time she makes a stop and picks\nup more pilgrims to accompany her, the group grows substantially.\nHer strengths as a pilgrim involve reaching out to others, as when\ncaring for her children, receiving weak or disabled pilgrims into\nher group, and marrying off her sons. In contrast, Part I portrays\npilgrimage as a solitary activity. Though Christian finds companions\nin Faithful and Hopeful, he never seems to need them. He could progress\njust as well without them. In fact, when Christian experiences his\noriginal spiritual crisis and decides to leave his home and city,\nhe does so alone, as if solitude were necessary to feel the divine\nword. Yet when Christian cries after the four mistresses of the\nPalace Beautiful ask why he left his family, he displays a hidden\nlonging for his family. Bunyan emphasizes here that spirituality\nis best when it is communal. Christian does not end up in solitary\nbliss wandering alone in heaven but in the Celestial City filled\nwith happy throngs of residents. His community is a large group\nof similar-minded people. Yet Christiana instinctively knows what\nChristian learns in the end: spiritual existence should involve\ntogetherness."]}}, "quotes": {"link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/pilgrims/quotes/", "important_quotations_explained": {"But must\nI needs want solidness, because By metaphors I speak?

Bunyan\ndenies that his book must “want,” or lack, solidity simply because\nit uses a metaphorical style. He affirms that metaphors can go hand\nin hand with serious thought.", "Bunyan’s self-defense goes to the heart of a long-standing\ntradition of religious leaders looking askance at literature and\ndeeming it mere entertainment, empty of spiritual value. Religious\nfiction writers through the ages have defended themselves in much\nthe same way that Bunyan does here. He notes that the Bible itself\ncontains metaphors and “types,” or examples representing general\ntruths. God’s gospel laws refer to the New Testament, in which Christ\ndelivers many of his most profound spiritual statements through\nparables in which the actual content of the story is different from\nwhat the story seems to portray.

The quotation forcefully displays Christian’s sense of identity\nand his sense of who he is in the world. Christian does not think\nof mentioning his own name in his introduction. Partly he does not\nthink of his name because he represents all Christian pilgrims in\nthis allegory. Christian is an Everyman, and he does not need a\nname because he symbolizes all. But in psychological terms, Christian’s\nomission of his name reveals something more about him: he has very\nlittle self-consciousness in the book. He reflects on himself when\nhe contemplates his own situation, but he rarely thinks about himself\nto review his emotions or ideas. Christian has a soul that he cares\nabout saving but does not have a very distinct personality or sense\nof self. And without a self, he has no need for a name.", "Despite not having much of a personality, Christian defines\nhimself by his moral status (“poor burdened sinner”), origin in\nthe City of Destruction, and ultimate goal to reach the Celestial\nCity. He explains his reasons for setting out and speaks to the\ngatekeeper only because he needs to overcome the obstacle in his\nway and continue his journey. Everything he says in this quotation\nrefers to his basic need to advance, and he defines himself solely\nas a traveler. In Christian’s view, his starting point and end point\ncommunicate all there is to know about him. Christian’s politeness\nto the gatekeeper, whom he calls “sir,” shows his cordial respect\nfor people of all social levels, high and low. This formality remains\nconstant throughout ", "The Pilgrim’s Progress", " and\nexpresses Christian’s deep religious belief that all are equal before\nGod."], "By this\nI perceive thou art one of my subjects; for all that country is\nmine, and I am the Prince and God of it.

Apollyon’s\nsmooth and courtly speech contradicts his grotesque appearance,\nwhich features fish scales and bear-like feet. The disconnection\nbetween word and meaning runs throughout the book. Like Apollyon’s\nwords, many utterances by evildoers on Christian’s pilgrimage will\nsound good but reveal a monstrous origin and an evil intention.\nApollyon also uses logic to great effect by addressing Christian\nwith a medieval syllogism, or logical exercise: Christian comes\nfrom Destruction, and Apollyon is the prince of Destruction. Therefore\nChristian is Apollyon’s royal subject. Of course Christian rejects\nthis logic, knowing that truth must come not from rational argument\nbut from divine revelation.", "Apollyon refers to himself as not only a prince of the\nCity of Destruction but as “god” of it as well. The bold and grandiose\nstatement foreshadows Madam Bubble’s later reference to herself\nas a goddess. All such claims of divinity in ", "The Pilgrim’s\nProgress", " have a false ring, since any good religious Christian\nsoul knows that there is and can be only one God in the universe.\nNo one falls prey to these false claims in ", "The Pilgrim’s\nProgress", ". Moreover, anyone who has to tell a person in\na conversation that he or she is a god must be self-conscious. A\ngood pilgrim like Christian does not refer to himself at all, unless\nit is to reveal his moral condition or the progress of his journey.\nAs a result, self-consciousness itself is linked to evil in this book."], "Well,\nsaid she, my Sons, you transgress, for that fruit is none of ours;\nbut she did not know that they did belong to the Enemy: I’ll warrant\nyou, if she had, she would have been ready to die for fear. ": ["Christiana delivers this reproach to\nher sons in the Fourth Stage of Part II, when they have been caught\npilfering fruit from the devil’s garden. Christiana does not seem\naware of how close she comes to repeating God’s reproach to Adam\nand Eve in Genesis, when the first humans were similarly chastised\nfor their fruit-eating transgression. Her religious outlook is so\ndevoutly steeped in the Bible that she lives out biblical verses\nwithout even realizing it. However, Bunyan alters the biblical story\na bit. Christiana becomes angry with her children but cannot cast\nthem out as God did. She is in effect a single mother for most of\nthe book, and she must be practical as well as devout. All she can\ndo is warn her sons of their sins and trust that they will see the\nlight.", "The quote shows ", "The Pilgrim’s Progress", " shifting\nbetween an allegory and a novel.", "Bunyan explains how Christiana would have felt if she\nhad known the fruit was the devil’s. When he says that she would\nhave died of fear, he offers an alternate version of his own tale\nthat reveals how he treats Christiana like a character in a novel,\ncapable of making decisions, rather than a character in an allegory.\nHere Bunyan struggles between writing an allegory and novel. While ", "The\nPilgrim’s Progress", " is clearly an allegory, there are moments\nin which Bunyan writes like a novelist and shows that he understands\nthat he might have written the story another way. He says that Christiana could\nhave behaved differently, which implies that he sees her as existing\nseparate from his allegory."], "Apples\nwere they with which we were beguiled, Yet Sin, not Apples, hath our souls defiled. ": ["This rhymed couplet, spoken by the host\nGaius to Christiana’s son over dinner in the Sixth Stage of Part\nII, demonstrates different ways of interpreting even things as simple\nas apples. Christiana’s son obviously has been exposed to the Bible\nsince he knows that Adam and Eve committed the first sin by eating\nforbidden apples. Matthew tries to apply biblical lessons to his\nown life and live devoutly, and he naturally assumes that apples\nare evil and that he should avoid them at all costs. But here at\ndinner, he learns that applying religious lessons to life is more\ncomplicated than it seems. Gaius informs Matthew that there is a\ndifference between the apples that Adam and Eve ate and the sin\nthey committed by doing so. In allegory, an apple is sin, but in\nlife apples are simply apples.", "Gaius’s poetic meter and fancy word choice set him apart\nfrom the simpler souls met by the pilgrims on their journey in Part\nII. Gaius’s name is also out of the ordinary, being a noble Roman\nname far removed from the direct descriptions that are applied as\nnames to Great-heart, Feeble-mind, and so on. Gaius seems to belong\nto another world. He belongs not in a Christian allegory but in\na classical Latin poem. In Bunyan’s day a fierce debate raged about\nthe value of the classical Greek and Roman writers. Some claimed\nthese writers were noble and beneficial to humanity. Others claimed\nthey were irreligious and ought to be ignored. Bunyan does not enter directly\ninto this debate, but by making Gaius as strongly Christian as all\nthe other good characters in the book, Bunyan seems to suggest that\na character with a Latin-sounding name can contribute a chapter\nto a devoutly Christian book. When Christiana’s two sons marry Gaius’s\ntwo daughters, a marriage of Christian and classical seems underway."]}}}

Within the framework of the chess game,\nAlice has little control over the trajectory of her life, and outside\nforces influence her choices and actions. Just as Alice exerts little\ncontrol of her movement toward becoming a queen, she has no power\nover her inevitable maturation and acceptance of womanhood. At the\nbeginning of the game, Alice acts as a pawn with limited perspective\nof the world around her. She has limited power to influence outcomes\nand does not fully understand the rules of the game, so an unseen\nhand guides her along her journey, constructing different situations\nand encounters that push her along toward her goal. Though she wants to\nbecome a queen, she must follow the predetermined rules of the chess\ngame, and she frequently discovers that every step she takes toward\nher goal occurs because of outside forces acting upon her, such\nas the mysterious train ride and her rescue by the White Knight. By\nusing the chess game as the guiding principle of the narrative, Carroll\nsuggest that a larger force guides individuals through life and\nthat all events are preordained.

Similarly, Humpty Dumpty’s fall does not happen\nuntil Alice describes the events in the classic nursery rhyme. Language\ncovers actions in Looking-Glass World, rather than simply describing them.\nThe flowers reinforce this principle by explaining that a tree can\nscare enemies away with its “bark.” In our language, there is no relationship\nbetween the bark of a dog and the bark of a tree, but in Looking-Glass\nWorld, this linguistic similarity results in a functional common\nground.

The photographic quality of the passage\nindicates that Carroll has inserted himself and his desires into\nthe text, since Carroll created the White Knight as his literary\ncounterpart.

Given the circumstances of the treatment of women of her\ntime, there is no way they could have rivaled men in literary achievements.\nThe narrator invents the figure of Judith Shakespeare to illustrate\nthis point. She tells a story of a fictional twin sister of Shakespeare,\nwho is just as talented as her famous brother but, because\nshe is a woman, her talent leads to a very different end."], "Life for\nboth sexes—and I look at them, shouldering their way along the pavement—is\narduous, difficult, a perpetual struggle. It calls for gigantic\ncourage and strength. More than anything, perhaps, creatures of\nillusion that we are, it calls for confidence in oneself. ": ["Woolf presents this claim in Chapter\nTwo.

Rather, she sympathizes\nwith men in their quest for confidence, and she speaks of the importance\nof confidence in creating art. The lack of confidence amongst women\nhas led to the generally inferior quality of their art. To Woolf,\nthe anger in women about their plight as second-class citizens is\nreflected in their writing. And yet, they persist. She relates the\nfact that women continue to write even though they are actually\nlacking in confidence to the way that people continue living their\nlives even when wracked by doubt about their relevance in society.\nIn this way, she depicts women as valiant."]}}}

The five women narrate the novel. From the outset, the attitudes of the five women cover a wide spectrum. The mother, Orleanna passively accepts the turn of events, as she passively accepts everything her husband tells her. Fifteen-year-old beauty queen Rachel resents her separation from normal teen life. Five year old adventurer Ruth May is both excited and frightened. Fourteen-year-old Leah, who alone shares her father's ardent religious faith, is enthusiastic. Leah's twin Adah a cripple and mute by birth, but also a brilliant observer, merely views the move, as she does all of life, with a wry and cynical detachment. One thing that the women share, however, is the unwavering faith that they are carrying with them a culture far superior to the one already existing in the village of Kilanga, and that they will therefore instantly be masters of their new domain.", "\n", "It does not take long for this faith to begin to waver. The first sign that they have miscalculated the superiority of their way of life comes when Nathan attempts to plant a vegetable garden. His \"demonstration garden\" is intended to both provide food for his family, and to instruct the natives in simple agricultural principles that might save them from malnutrition. However, though his garden grows lush and huge, none of his plants ever bear fruit. It takes him several weeks to realize that his plants cannot bear fruit here, because there are no African pollinators suited to North American vegetables. The next, and much larger, blow comes when their live-in helper, Mama Tataba becomes so enraged at Nathan's insistence on baptism for the villagers that she deserts them. As Mama Tataba explains in her final burst of anger, the villagers will never agree to being dunked in the river because a crocodile recently ate a young girl in that very river.", "\n", "Though the women are shaken by these events, and slowly affected by the culture around them, Nathan remains steadfast in his original goals. He refuses to give up the attempt to baptize the villagers, or to bend his will in any way. When the only English-speaking member of the village, the handsome young school teacher, Anatole, informs Nathan that the chief, Tata Ndu, looks askance at his proselytizing, and fears that a move toward Christianity will spell the moral decline of his people, Nathan becomes outraged and throws Anatole out of his house rather than trying to gather more insight from him into the traditional religious life of the village. Even when their situation becomes mortally dangerous, Nathan clings tenaciously to his mission.

Nathan Price serves as the personal embodiment of Western hubris, unquestioning in his missionary zeal to overturn the ancient traditions of the Congo and replace them with his own religious beliefs. Yet nearly all of the non-African characters are marked by this fault for at least some portion of the book. From Leah's initial certainty in her father's mission, to Underdowns' patronizing racism, each character comes over to Africa confident that they are bringing with them a superior way of life. It is the United States government, however, that wields its cultural arrogance most dangerously, feeling entitled to assassinate a foreign nation's president and replace him with its own puppet ruler."], "Pantheism as a Superior Form of Religious Faith": ["Brother Fowles, who symbolizes the positive side of Christianity, is the first to introduce the idea of pantheism, or a worship of all of nature as part of God, into the book. Orleanna, herself a former nature worshipper, quickly picks up on this idea and seems, on her long walks and later in her gardening, to adopt it as her own form of spirituality. By the end of the book both Adah and Leah seem to have come around to versions of pantheism as well, with Leah claiming that her sense of God is \"some kin to the passion of Brother Fowleswho advised me to trust in creation\" (Song of the Three Children: Leah Price) and Adah declaring that, \"God is everything then\" (Songs of the Three Children: Adah Price).", "Given that cultural arrogance is presented as the great sin of the West and traditional forms of Christianity as one of this sin's primary vehicles, it is not surprising to find pantheism being presented as the spiritual antidote. The notion that all the natural world is divine necessarily inspires a certain respect and modesty in anyone who believes it. It speaks against the attitude of \"subdue and conquer\" that Western thought applies to both the natural world and to the human beings who inhabit it."], "The Individuality of How to Deal with the Burden of Guilt": ["\n", "The Poisonwood Bible", " is a political allegory. Though the story it tells focuses on the guilt of five women, for example their private guilt over the death of a daughter and sister, and their public guilt over the role they played in Africa's tragedies, it is really about the guilt that all United States citizens share. It poses the question: what did our nation do in the Congo, and how should we respond to this fact?", "There is no one right answer to the question, \"how should we live with the burden of guilt?\" To pose just one answer and claim that it is the correct one would not only be narrow-minded, but also somewhat uninteresting for being so blatantly false. This is why Kingsolver chooses to have the story told by five separate narrators. Each narrator represents a different answer to the question, \"how should we live with the burden of guilt,\" covering the spectrum from Orleanna's complete paralysis to Rachel's nonchalant refusal to even accept the burden. In between these extremes there is Leah, who responds with political activism—that is, with an active attempt to right the wrongs in the world—and Adah who responds scientifically, with an attempt to understand and make sense of the world on its most fundamental level. Even Ruth May, whose death is the cause of the more personal level of guilt felt by these women, represents a point on the spectrum of guilt, coming at the question with an all-accepting spirituality. These responses together are not meant to exhaust the possible reactions one might take toward guilt. They are only five possibilities out of an infinite number of options."], "The Impossibility of Absolute and Unambiguous Justice on a Global Scale": ["In forming their different approaches to the world, the Price women also come to very different conceptions of justice. However, what emerges as a theme among those who address the issue is the insistence that a complete routing of injustice from the world is impossible. Adah gives up any lingering belief in a human-centric world, and so thinks of justice in global terms. Absolute justice, at least the crude sort of justice that Westerners believe in, she tells us, is impossible. We think, for instance, that it is unjust that in Africa young babies die of malnutrition and disease. To correct this injustice, we send over doctors to feed and inoculate them. Yet, Adah, points out, the result of this good deed is simply death of a different sort. Overpopulation leads to food shortage, deforestation, and the extinction of species. We cannot change the balance of the world, eliminating all that we consider sad and wrong. The world maintains its own balance. One life form will always have to die for another to live, whether that is one person for another, one animal, or one virus. Adah does not despair over this ruthless balancing act, but marvels over it. She is able to rise above her human skin and view the world as an objective observer, much as she once viewed her family and Kilanga in this way. From this vantage point the shaky accord between human, plant, virus, and mineral is admirable rather than frustrating."]}}, "quotes": {"link": "https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/poisonwood/quotes/", "important_quotations_explained": {" Maybe I'll even confess the truth, that I rode in with the horsemen and beheld the apocolypse, but still I'll insist I was only a captive witness. What is the conqueror's wife if not a conquest herself? ": ["This quote appears in Orleanna's opening narrative, and immediately introduces us to the dominant theme in ", "The Poisonwood Bible", ": the attempt to grapple with guilt. Orleanna's guilt is twofold. There is the paralyzing guilt she feels over her complicity in the death of her youngest daughter, and also the scarcely less overwhelming guilt she suffers because of the crimes perpetrated by the United States against the natives of Congo. This passage is meant to call our attention to both of these guilty burdens. By calling herself the \"conqueror's wife,\" Orleanna places herself in a particular position with respect to the guilt she is feeling. She is not the primary perpetrator of the act, but she is closely connected to that perpetrator and perhaps even benefited from his crimes. The true perpetrator of the first crime is her husband, Nathan, whose crazed zealotry placed the entire family in mortal danger. In this case, the relationship of wife is not even metaphorical. The perpetrator of the second crime is the United States, and here the relationship of wife is metaphorical, invoking the dependency, responsibility, and even loyalty that a citizen bears to his or her nation. Orleanna is not alone in her role as the United States' wife as she is alone in her other wifely role. Kingsolver intends for all of us to consider ourselves as this particular conqueror's wife, bearing the guilt and responsibility for the crimes our nation committed in the Congo. As Orleanna and her daughters work through their own guilt, we are also supposed to be thinking of ways to deal with our own."], " The smiling bald man with the grandfather face has another face. ": ["Adah makes this statement in Book Three, when she discovers that Dwight Eisenhower, President of the United States, is behind the CIA plot to overthrow the elected government of Congo and assassinate its president. It is strange, and also significant, that these words are spoken by Adah, since they more perfectly capture the growing disillusionment with father figures (Nathan, God, and American leaders) that Orleanna and Leah are experiencing. The following morning, Adah's surprise wears off and her usual cynicism creeps back in; she reasons that Eisenhower's discovered treachery is not that different from the fact that \"Grandfather God\" damns children to hell just for bring unbaptized. Yet here Adah reveals herself as not quite so immune to the idealization of her culture as she imagined herself. Though she fashions herself a complete cynic, here we see her shocked, even if only for a few hours, by the discovery that the President of the United States can be an evil man.", "The growing disillusionment experienced by Orleanna, Adah, and Leah with regard to the traditional father figures, dominates the first two thirds of the book. Losing faith first in Nathan, then in their old conception of God, and finally in the United States, they are left abandoned and alone in a world they no longer understand. Once the disillusionment is complete, a process that ends for Leah and Orleanna when Ruth May dies (Adah's disillusionment peaks during the driver ant episode), the remaining action is dominated by their attempt to replace their old beliefs with new ones, and their false father figures with truer figures of authority and respect."], " I felt the breath of God go cold on my skin. ": ["Leah utters this as she rows with Anatole across the river and away from the driver ants, in Book Three. Amid the tumult of escape, Leah and Anatole continue an ongoing discussion of race and justice, and Leah finally suffers her ultimate crisis of faith. Moments later she replaces her old faith with a new one, murmuring Anatole's name over and over feeling that, \"it took the place of prayer.\" Her love for Anatole becomes her new anchoring force, taking the place of her father and his simplistic vision of God.", "Though it is Anatole who goads her here into admitting that life is not an equation with deeds on one side and reward and punishment on the other, his last small pushes are really superfluous. Leah's crisis has been building steadily, egged on by her observations in Kingala and Leopoldville, as well as by her eye- opening philosophical discussion with Anatole. However, it takes the mortal tumult caused by the driver ants to finally sever her desperate ties to a belief in a just and comforting God. Convinced that they are all about to die, she no longer has the will to force herself to believe in something she has probably not truly believed in for many months."], " \"In the world, the carrying capacity for humans is limited. History holds all things in the balance, including large hopes and short lives.\" ": ["This is Adah's take on the notion of justice, given to us in Book Five.

We think, for instance, that it is unjust that in Africa young babies die of malnutrition and disease. To correct this injustice, we send over doctors to feed and inoculate them. Yet, Adah, points out, the result of this good deed is simply death of a different sort. Overpopulation leads to food shortage, deforestation, and further disease. We cannot change the balance of the world, eliminating all that we consider sad and wrong. The world maintains its own balance, juggling human, animal, plant, microbe, mineral and so on in an elaborate scheme of life and death. Rather than despair over this state of affairs, Adah actually stands in awe of it, finding herself rooting no more passionately for the humans than any other of the major players in the global game of survival—rooting, actually, just for the survival of the vast, balancing game itself."], " I am the unmissionary, as Adah would say, beginning every day on my knees asking to be converted. ": ["In this passage, stated in Book Six, Leah expresses her guilt over being born white and American. In contrast to the missionaries, like her father and even her young self, who sought to make the Africans just like Westerners, imposing our values on them, Leah wants to assimilate entirely to the African culture around her. She has come full circle, from missionary to unmissionary.", "Like Adah's remark about the impossibility of global justice, this remark of Leah's is closely tied to her ideas about justice in the narrower, human sphere. Just as Adah despairs of global justice, Leah despairs of true human justice, but her response is not to look on dispassionately and admire this fact. Instead her response is, on the active level, to do all she can to minimize injustice. On the emotional level, however, her response to inevitable injustice is to want to distance herself as far as possible from those who are responsible for so much of it."]}}}
