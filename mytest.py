Santiago consults a gypsy woman to interpret the dream, and to his\n            surprise she tells him to go to Egypt. A strange, magical old man named Melchizedek, who\n            claims to be the King of Salem, echoes the gypsy’s advice and tells Santiago that it is\n            his Personal Legend to journey to the pyramids. Melchizedek convinces Santiago to sell\n            his flock and set off to Tangier. When Santiago arrives in Tangier, a thief robs him,\n            forcing him to find work with a local crystal merchant. The conservative and kindly\n            merchant teaches Santiago several lessons, and Santiago encourages the merchant to take\n            risks with his business.

He learns a\n            lot from the Englishman during the journey. For one, he learns that the secret of\n            alchemy is written on a stone called the Emerald Tablet. The ultimate creation of\n            alchemy is the Master Work, which consists of a solid called the Philosophers Stone that\n            can turn lead to gold, and a liquid called the Elixir of Life that can cure all ills.\n            Santiago learns the Englishman is traveling with the caravan to the Saharan oasis of\n            Al-Fayoum, where a powerful, 200-year-old alchemist resides.

During a walk in the desert, Santiago\n            witnesses an omen that portends an attack on the historically neutral oasis. He warns\n            the tribal chieftains of the attack, and as a result, Al-Fayoum successfully defends\n            itself against the assault. The alchemist gets word of Santiago’s vision and invites\n            Santiago on a trip into the desert, during which he teaches Santiago about the\n            importance of listening to his heart and pursuing his Personal Legend.

In exchange for his life and the\n            life of Santiago, the alchemist hands over to the tribe all of Santiago’s money and\n            tells the soldiers that Santiago is a powerful alchemist who will turn into wind within\n            three days. Santiago feels alarmed because he has no idea how to turn into the wind, and\n            over the next three days he contemplates the desert. On the third day, he communicates\n            with the wind and the sun and coaxes them to help him create a tremendous sandstorm. He\n            prays to the Hand That Wrote All, and at the height of the storm he disappears.

In fact, the\n                    universe can only achieve perfection if all natural things continuously undergo\n                    a cycle of achieving their Personal Legend, evolving into a higher being with a\n                    new Personal Legend, and then pursuing that new goal. This concept, that the\n                    individualistic pursuit of a Personal Legend exists as life’s dominant—perhaps\n                    only—spiritual demand, lies at the center of the unique theology of ", "The\n                        Alchemist.", " As we see when Santiago must give up his flock and leave\n                    Fatima, material success and even love pose obstacles to Santiago achieving his\n                    Personal Legend and must be delayed or ignored altogether.

In the novel, even alchemy, the central symbol of\n                    the book, entails coaxing metal to achieve its own Personal Legend to turn into\n                    gold. As a result, the idea that all individuals should live in the singular\n                    pursuit of their individual dreams emerges as the primary theme of ", "The\n                        Alchemist.", "\n"], "The Unity of Nature": ["In ", "The Alchemist,", " the spiritual unity represented by the\n                    Soul of the World binds together all of nature, from human beings to desert\n                    sand. This idea underlies the parallel we see in the novel between the alchemist\n                    purifying metal into gold and Santiago purifying himself into someone capable of\n                    achieving his Personal Legend. According to the novel, the Soul of the World has\n                    created an ultimate desire, or Personal Legend, for everything, whether Santiago\n                    or a piece of iron. To accomplish its Personal Legend, each thing must learn to\n                    tap into the Soul of the World, which purifies it. That continual purification\n                    ultimately leads to perfection. This notion of humans, metals, and all other\n                    things sharing the same goal demonstrates that all elements in nature are\n                    essentially different forms of a single spirit.", "Furthermore, over and over again we see that Santiago must communicate\n                    with nature in what the novel calls the common language of the world.

As the alchemist\n                    says when he leaves Santiago, everything from a grain of sand to God himself\n                    shares the same spiritual essence.

The irony of this fear stems from the fact that\n                    Santiago earns ever greater rewards each time he abandons his fear and gives up\n                    his previous possessions.", "This quotation also raises the notion that a person should have no reason\n                    to fear anything if he recognizes that he plays a role in something greater than\n                    his own life. The camel driver speaks these lines to Santiago from experience,\n                    having lost all of his possessions when a flood destroyed his orchard farm. He\n                    acknowledges, however, that the same hand that writes a person’s life story also\n                    writes the history of the world. In other words, each person’s life plays a part\n                    in the larger world around him, and the camel driver suggests that God dictates\n                    that part. This realization doesn’t prevent a person from suffering tragedies,\n                    but if the person recognizes that his tragedy serves a higher purpose, he has no\n                    reason to fear any loss. This insight becomes important to Santiago as he faces\n                    challenges later in the book, particularly as he learns to stop fearing failure\n                    and to trust in the omens he sees."], "4. “The alchemists spent years in their laboratories, observing the\n                    fire that purified the metals.

They discovered that the\n                    purification of the metals had led to a purification of\n                themselves.” ": ["The Englishman relates this history to Santiago as Santiago reads a book\n                    on alchemy.

Just as alchemists\n                    purify lead, removing its impurities to transform it into gold, a person can\n                    purify himself by focusing completely on living out his Personal Legend. This\n                    process strips the person of impurities, transforming him as the lead is\n                    transformed.

This idea implies that all other desires, including\n                    that for romantic love, should play a secondary role to pursuing one’s Personal\n                    Legend."], "5. “What you still need to know is this: before a dream is realized,\n                    the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way.

In short, the alchemist explains to Santiago why he had\n                    to endure so many trials if the universe, as the alchemist and others have said,\n                    does actually want him to fulfill his Personal Legend.

When he must\n                    turn himself into the wind, Santiago seems as if he has to trick the elements\n                    into helping him. But as the alchemist explains, these challenges served their\n                    own purpose: to help Santiago master the lessons he had already\n                    learned.", "The alchemist’s statement implies that the important part of pursuing\n                    one’s Personal Legend consists not just in reaching the final goal, whether that\n                    be turning lead into gold or finding a treasure near the pyramids, but also in\n                    learning through action. Earlier in the book, the alchemist explains this notion\n                    to Santiago using alchemists as his example. He says the alchemists became too\n                    focused on the gold and lost the focus on living out their Personal Legends.
